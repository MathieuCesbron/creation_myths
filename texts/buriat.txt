in the beginning there were only the waters and the god sombov until the god saw the water bird anghir. sombov ordered the bird to dive into the waters and bring back some earth. the bird re- turned carrying both black earth and red clay. out of the first, sombov molded the earth; out of the clay he made two wool- covered beings·man and woman·but he decided not to give them life until he had obtained souls for them. while sombov went off to heaven to get the souls, he left a dog·at this point in creation still without fur·to watch over his unfinished work. the dog, shiv- ering in the cold, did as he was told, but shiktur, the devil, came by and promised the dog a fur coat if he would let him see the new humans. the dog gave in, and shiktur fouled the new creations by spit- ting on them. when sombov returned, he was, of course, furious. for its disobedi- ence, the dog was condemned to a life of shivering in spite of its coat. wherever the devilês spit had touched the humans the wool had to be removed from their flesh, leaving them·especially the woman·naked in all but certain parts of their bodies. at least the humans were given life and souls.
