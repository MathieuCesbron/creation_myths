one myth says that great man alone lived on a then-molten earth but desired something more. when earth cooled, he created a woman and together they produced the people. a group of maidu near the sacramento river believed that a great flood overcame the land, leaving only two survivors, the primal parents of the maidu, who were blessed by the great man.
