in the beginning it was only water and twilight everywhere and only an island existed, the island of the gods which floated somewhere at the edge of the world and could be visible during sunrise. degei was alone and the only living creature was the female hawk named turukawa.turukawa couldn’t speak and the only thing she would do was to fly around earth, until she started gathering leaves and grass creating a nest and finally two eggs were created. the great god degei took the two eggs to his house where he made a bed for them and kept them warm with his body. when the eggs hatched, two tiny human beings came out, they were his children. once the first humans were born, they were transferred to a vesi tree where degei built a shelter for them, fed them and taught them the secrets of nature. but he kept his children separate. he planted trees around them so they could find food, trees like banana trees, dalo and yams. however, humans could only eat from the banana tree and not dalo (or taro) and yams (like sweet potatoes), because they didn’t know the art of fire and the fruits of those trees couldn’t be eaten raw. dalo and yams were the food of the gods. when the first humans grew up they met each other and asked degei to show them how to harness the power of the fire and how to eat the food of the gods, and so degei taught them. and it was after a while that the first humans left degei and went to live on their own and had their first children. degei wasn’t upset since he knew that his children and their children would worship him as their god.
