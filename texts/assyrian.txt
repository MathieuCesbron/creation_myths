after the earth and heavens and the mother goddess had been created, the great sky gods the annunaki led by anu (sky), enlil (storms and earth), shamash (sun), and ea (water), looked out over their creation and wondered what else they needed to do. the beautiful tigris and euphrates rivers flowed majestically to the sea, and the destinies of heaven and earth were established, but something seemed to be lacking. it was decided that mankind was needed to till the fields, celebrate religious festivals, and constantly retell the origin stories. this new being would be made of the blood of certain sacrificed deities. so it was that the first humans ulligarra (abundance) and zalgarra (plenty) were created. their destinies were established by the lady of the gods, aruru.
