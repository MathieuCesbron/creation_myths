the creator, otsirvani, and his helper, chagan-shukuty, came down from above and noticed a frog diving into the water. chagan-shukuty reached down for it and turned it onto its back so otsirvani could sit on its stomach. otsirvani ordered his assistant to dive to the bottom of the waters and bring back whatever he found there. after several attempts, chagan-shukuty brought back some earth, and otsirvani ordered him to sprinkle it on the frogÃªs stomach. now the frog sank a bit under the weight, leaving only the earth visible, and the two gods rested on the new earth. while they were sleeping, the devil came by and decided to destroy the gods and their new earth. he picked up the sleeping creators and ran with them towards what he thought would be the waters, but the farther he ran, the more the earth grew. finally, he dropped the sacred beings, who woke up. otsirvani explained to his companion what had happened and praised the new earth for saving them.
