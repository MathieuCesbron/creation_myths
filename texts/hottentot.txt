the hottentot people come from tsui-goab, which once fought a long and difficult battle against a negative force, gaunab. as the evil one was dying he wounded the good one's knee, leading to the name tsui-goab, which means sore knee. the lame god is the provider of all good things: rain, crops, animals. his home is in heaven. the evil one lives in another, dark heaven.
