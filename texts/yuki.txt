in the beginning there was foam that wandered around on the surface of fogcovered waters. a voice came from the foam followed by taiko-mol, who had eagle feathers on his head. the creator stood on the moving foam and sang as he created. in the darkness he made a rope, and he laid it out on the northsouth axis. then he walked along it, coiling it and leaving the created earth behind him as he went. he did this four times, and each time the water overwhelmed the new land. as he walked he wondered if there was a better way. then he made four stone posts, or lilkae, and secured them in the ground in each of the four directions. he attached lines to these and stretched them out across the world as a plan. finally he spoke the word and the earth was born. then the creator secured the new world from the waters by lining it with whale hide. he shook the earth to see that it was indeed secureÂ·this was the first earthquake. earthquakes since then are taiko-mol retesting his work.
