in the beginning wulbari (heaven· male) lived on top of asase ya (earth· female). man lived between them, but with little room to move. manês squirming irritated wulbari so much that he left and went up above. one of the things that bothered wulbari was an old woman who, when grinding maize, kept hitting him with her pestle, and the smoke from the cooking fires bothered his eyes. some say that wulbari was annoyed because men would sometimes wipe their dirty hands on him. the krachi people say that there was an old woman who used to cut off bits of wulbari to flavor her soup. it is said that the krachi people originated when wulbari sent down a group of men and another of women and the men, after a time, decided to go to the women to mate with them. when death came to the krachi in the form of a human-flesh-eating giant bird, wulbari gave the dog a medicine to cure his appointed people, the humans. but the dog put the medicine down to eat a bone, and it was picked up by the goat, whose appointed people was grass. so grass got the medicine and comes back every year, whereas people simply die.
