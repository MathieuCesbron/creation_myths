 in the name of the creator ohrmazd the zand-akas zand-knowing or tradition-informed which is first about ohrmazds original creation and the antagonism of the evil spirit and afterwards about the nature of the creatures from the original creation till the end which is the future existence tanu-i pasino as revealed by the religion of the mazdayasnians so it is declared that ohrmazd is supreme in omniscience and goodness and unrivaled in splendor the region of light is the place of ohrmazd which they call endless light and the omniscience and goodness of the unrivaled ohrmazd is what they call revelation revelation is the explanation of both spirits together one is he who is independent of unlimited time because ohrmazd and the region religion and time of ohrmazd were and are and ever will be while ahriman in darkness with backward understanding and desire for destruction was in the abyss and it is he who will not be and the place of that destruction and also of that darkness is what they call the endlessly dark and between them was empty space that is what they call air in which is now their meeting both are limited and unlimited spirits for the supreme is that which they call endless light and the abyss that which is endlessly dark so that between them is a void and one is not connected with the other and again both spirits are limited as to their own selves and secondly on account of the omniscience of ohrmazd both things are in the creation of ohrmazd the finite and the infinite for this they know is that which is in the covenant of both spirits and again the complete sovereignty of the creatures of ohrmazd is in the future existence and that also is unlimited for ever and everlasting and the creatures of ahriman will perish at the time when the future existence occurs and that also is eternity ohrmazd through omniscience knew that ahriman exists and whatever he schemes he infuses with malice and greediness till the end and because he accomplishes the end by many means he also produced spiritually the creatures which were necessary for those means and they remained three-thousand years in a spiritual state so that they were unthinking and unmoving with intangible bodies the evil spirit on account of backward knowledge was not aware of the existence of ohrmazd and afterwards he arose from the abyss and came in unto the light which he saw desirous of destroying and because of his malicious nature he rushed in to destroy that light of ohrmazd unassailed by fiends and he saw its bravery and glory were greater than his own so he fled back to the gloomy darkness and formed many demons and fiends and the creatures of the destroyer arose for violence ohrmazd by whom the creatures of the evil spirit were seen creatures terrible corrupt and bad also considered them not commendable burzishnik afterwards the evil spirit saw the creatures of ohrmazd there appeared many creatures of delight vayah inquiring creatures and they seemed to him commendable and he commended the creatures and creation of ohrmazd then ohrmazd with a knowledge of which way the end of the matter would be went to meet the evil spirit and proposed peace to him and spoke thus evil spirit bring assistance unto my creatures and offer praise so that in reward for it ye you and your creatures may become immortal and undecaying hungerless and thirstless and the evil spirit shouted thus i will not depart i will not provide assistance for thy creatures i will not offer praise among thy creatures and i am not of the same opinion with thee as to good things i will destroy thy creatures for ever and everlasting moreover i will force all thy creatures into disaffection to thee and affection for myself and the explanation thereof is this that the evil spirit reflected in this manner that ohrmazd was helpless as regarded him therefore he proffers peace and he did not agree but bore on even into conflict with him and ohrmazd spoke thus you are not omniscient and almighty o evil spirit so that it is not possible for thee to destroy me and it is not possible for thee to force my creatures so that they will not return to my possession then ohrmazd through omniscience knew that if i do not grant a period of contest then it will be possible for him to act so that he may be able to cause the seduction of my creatures to himself as even now there are many of the intermixture of mankind who practice wrong more than right and ohrmazd spoke to the evil spirit thus appoint a period so that the intermingling of the conflict may be for nine-thousand years for he knew that by appointing this period the evil spirit would be undone then the evil spirit unobservant and through ignorance was content with that agreement just like two men quarreling together who propose a time thus let us appoint such-and-such a day for a fight ohrmazd also knew this through omniscience that within these nine thousand-years for three-thousand years everything proceeds by the will of ohrmazd three-thousand years there is an intermingling of the wills of ohrmazd and ahriman and the last three-thousand years the evil spirit is disabled and they keep the adversary away from the creatures afterwards ohrmazd recited the ahunwar thus yatha ahu vairyo as a heavenly lord is to be chosen c once and uttered the twenty-one words he also exhibited to the evil spirit his own triumph in the end and the impotence of the evil spirit the annihilation of the demons and the resurrection and undisturbed future existence of the creatures for ever and everlasting and the evil spirit who perceived his own impotence and the annihilation of the demons became confounded and fell back to the gloomy darkness even so as is declared in revelation that when one of its the ahunwars three parts was uttered the evil spirit contracted his body through fear and when two parts of it were uttered he fell upon his knees and when all of it was uttered he became confounded and impotent as to the harm he caused the creatures of ohrmazd and he remained three-thousand years in confusion ohrmazd created his creatures in the confusion of ahriman first he produced vohuman good thought by whom the progress of the creatures of ohrmazd was advanced the evil spirit first created mitokht falsehood and then akoman evil thought the first of ohrmazds creatures of the world was the sky and his good thought vohuman by good procedure produced the light of the world along with which was the good religion of the mazdayasnians this was because the renovation frashegird which happens to the creatures was known to him afterwards arose ardwahisht and then shahrewar and then spandarmad and then hordad and then amurdad from the dark world of ahriman were akoman and andar and then sovar and then nakahed and then tairev and zairik of ohrmazds creatures of the world the first was the sky the second water the third earth the fourth plants the fifth animals the sixth mankind on the formation of the luminaries ohrmazd produced illumination between the sky and the earth the constellation stars and those also not of the constellations then the moon and afterwards the sun as i shall relate first he produced the celestial sphere and the constellation stars are assigned to it by him especially these twelve whose names are varak the lamb tora the bull do-patkar the two-figures or gemini kalachang the crab sher the lion khushak virgo tarazhuk the balance gazdum the scorpion nimasp the centaur or sagittarius vahik capricorn dul the water-pot and mahik the fish which from their original creation were divided into the twenty-eight subdivisions of the astronomers of which the names are padevar pesh-parviz parviz paha avesar beshn rakhvad taraha avra nahn miyan avdem mashaha spur husru srob nur gel garafsha varant gau goi muru bunda kahtsar vaht miyan kaht and all his original creations residing in the world are committed to them so that when the destroyer arrives they overcome the adversary and their own persecution and the creatures are saved from those adversities as a specimen of a warlike army which is destined for battle they have ordained every single constellation of those thousand small stars as assistance and among those constellations four chieftains appointed on the four sides are leaders on the recommendation of those chieftains the many unnumbered stars are specially assigned to the various quarters and various places as the united strength and appointed power of those constellations as it is said that tishtar is the chieftain of the east sataves the chieftain of the west vanand the chieftain of the south and haptoring the chieftain of the north the great one which they call a gah period of the day which they say is the great one of the middle of the sky till just before the destroyer came was the midday or south one of the five that is the rapithwin ohrmazd performed the spiritual yazishn ceremony with the archangels amahraspand in the rapithwin gah and in the yazishn he supplied every means necessary for overcoming the adversary he deliberated with the consciousness bod and guardian spirits farohar of men and the omniscient wisdom brought forward among men spoke thus which seems to you the more advantageous when i shall present you to the world that you shall contend in a bodily form with the fiend druj and the fiend shall perish and in the end i shall have you prepared again perfect and immortal and in the end give you back to the world and you will be wholly immortal undecaying and undisturbed or that it be always necessary to provide you protection from the destroyer thereupon the guardian spirits of men became of the same opinion with the omniscient wisdom about going to the world on account of the evil that comes upon them in the world from the fiend druj ahriman and their becoming at last again unpersecuted by the adversary perfect and immortal in the future existence for ever and everlasting on the rush of the destroyer at the creatures it is said in revelation that the evil spirit when he saw the impotence of himself and the confederate ham-dast demons owing to the righteous man became confounded and seemed in confusion three-thousand years during that confusion the arch-fiends of the demons severally shouted thus rise up thou father of us for we will cause a conflict in the world the distress and injury from which will become those of ohrmazd and the archangels severally they twice recounted their own evil deeds and it pleased him not and that wicked evil spirit through fear of the righteous man was not able to lift up his head until the wicked jeh came at the completion of the three-thousand years and she shouted to the evil spirit thus rise up thou father of us for i will cause that conflict in the world wherefrom the distress and injury of ohrmazd and the archangels will arise and she twice recounted severally her own evil deeds and it pleased him not and that wicked evil spirit rose not from that confusion through fear of the righteous man and again the wicked jeh shouted thus rise up thou father of us for in that conflict i will shed thus much vexation on the righteous man and the laboring ox that through my deeds life will not be wanted and i will destroy their living souls nismo i will vex the water i will vex the plants i will vex the fire of ohrmazd i will make the whole creation of ohrmazd vexed and she so recounted those evil deeds a second time that the evil spirit was delighted and started up from that confusion and he kissed jeh upon the head and the pollution which they call menstruation became apparent in jeh he shouted to jeh thus what is thy wish so that i may give it thee and jeh shouted to the evil spirit thus a man is the wish so give it to me the form of the evil spirit was a log-like lizards vazak body and he appeared a young man of fifteen years to jeh and that brought the thoughts of jeh to him afterwards the evil spirit with the confederate demons went towards the luminaries and he saw the sky and he led them up fraught with malicious intentions he stood upon one-third of the inside of the sky and he sprang like a snake out of the sky down to the earth in the month frawardin and the day ohrmazd he rushed in at noon and thereby the sky was as shattered and frightened by him as a sheep by a wolf he came on to the water which was arranged below the earth and then the middle of this earth was pierced and entered by him afterwards he came to the vegetation then to the ox then to gayomard and then he came to fire so just like a fly he rushed out upon the whole creation and he made the world quite as injured and dark at midday as though it were in dark night and noxious creatures were diffused by him over the earth biting and venomous such as the snake scorpion frog kalvak and lizard vazak so that not so much as the point of a needle remained free from noxious creatures and blight was diffused by him over the vegetation and it withered away immediately and avarice want pain hunger disease lust and lethargy were diffused by him abroad upon the ox and gayomard before his coming to the ox ohrmazd ground up the healing fruit which some call binak small in water openly before its eyes so that its damage and discomfort from the calamity zanishn might be less and when it became at the same time lean and ill as its breath went forth and it passed away the ox also spoke thus the cattle are to be created and their work labor and care are to be appointed and before his coming to gayomard ohrmazd brought forth a sweat upon gayomard so long as he might recite a prayer vaj of one stanza vichast moreover ohrmazd formed that sweat into the youthful body of a man of fifteen years radiant and tall when gayomard issued from the sweat he saw the world dark as night and the earth as though not a needles point remained free from noxious creatures the celestial sphere was in revolution and the sun and moon remained in motion and the worlds struggle owing to the clamor of the mazendaran demons was with the constellations and the evil spirit thought that the creatures of ohrmazd were all rendered useless except gayomard and astwihad with a thousand demons causers of death were let forth by him on gayomard but his appointed time had not come and he astwihad obtained no means of noosing avizidano him as it is said that when the opposition of the evil spirit came the period of the life and rule of gayomard was appointed for thirty years after the coming of the adversary he lived thirty years and gayomard spoke thus although the destroyer has come mankind will be all of my race and this one thing is good when they perform duty and good works and afterwards he the evil spirit came to fire and he mingled smoke and darkness with it the planets with many demons dashed against the celestial sphere and they mixed the constellations and the whole creation was as disfigured as though fire disfigured every place and smoke arose over it and ninety days and nights the heavenly angels were contending in the world with the confederate demons of the evil spirit and hurled them confounded to hell and the rampart of the sky was formed so that the adversary should not be able to mingle with it hell is in the middle of the earth there where the evil spirit pierced the earth and rushed in upon it as all the possessions of the world were changing into duality and persecution contention and mingling of high and low became manifest this also is said that when the primeval ox passed away it fell to the right hand and gayomard afterwards when he passed away to the left hand goshorun as the soul of the primeval ox came out from the body of the ox stood up before the ox and cried to ohrmazd as much as a thousand men when they sustain a cry at one time thus with whom is the guardianship of the creatures left by thee when ruin has broken into the earth and vegetation is withered and water is troubled where is the man of whom it was said by thee thus i will produce him so that he may preach carefulness and ohrmazd spoke thus you are made ill o goshorun you have the illness which the evil spirit brought on if it were proper to produce that man in this earth at this time the evil spirit would not have been oppressive in it forth goshorun walked to the star station payak and cried in the same manner and forth to the moon station and cried in the same manner and forth to the sun station and then the guardian spirit of zartosht was exhibited to her and ohrmazd said thus i will produce for the world him who will preach carefulness contented became the spirit goshorun and assented thus i will nourish the creatures that is she became again consenting to a worldly creation in the world seven chieftains of the planets have come unto the seven chieftains of the constellations as the planet mercury tir unto tishtar the planet mars warharan unto haptoring the planet jupiter ohrmazd unto vanand the planet venus anahid unto sataves the planet saturn kevan unto the great one of the middle of the sky gochihr and the thievish dujgun mushpar provided with tails unto the sun and moon and stars the sun has attached mushpar to its own radiance by mutual agreement so that he may be less able to do harm vinas of mount alburz it is declared that around the world and mount terak which is the middle of the world the revolution of the sun is like a moat around the world it turns back in a circuit owing to the enclosure var of mount alburz around terak as it is said that it is the terak of alburz from behind which my sun and moon and stars return again for there are a hundred-and-eighty apertures rojin in the east and a hundred-and-eighty in the west through alburz and the sun every day comes in through an aperture and goes out through an aperture and the whole connection and motion of the moon and constellations and planets is with it every day it always illumines or warms three regions karshwar and a half as is evident to the eyesight and twice in every year the day and night are equal for on the original attack when it the sun went forth from its first degree khurdak the day and night were equal it was the season of spring when it arrives at the first degree of kalachang cancer the time of day is greatest it is the beginning of summer when it arrives at the sign khurdak tarachuk libra the day and night are equal it is the beginning of autumn when it arrives at the sign vahik capricorn the night is a maximum it is the beginning of winter and when it arrives at varak aries the night and day have again become equal as when it went forth from varak so that when it comes back to varak in three hundred-and-sixty days and the five gatha days it goes in and comes out through one and the same aperture the aperture is not mentioned for if it had been mentioned the demons would have known the secret and been able to introduce disaster from there where the sun comes on on the longest day to where it comes on on the shortest day is the east region sawahi from there where it comes on on the shortest day to where it goes off on the shortest day is the direction of the south regions fradadhafshu and widadhafshu from there where it goes in on the shortest day to where it goes in on the longest day is the west region arezahi from there where it comes in on the longest day to there where it goes in on the longest day are the north regions wourubareshti and wourujareshti when the sun comes on it illumines or warms the regions of sawahi fradadhafshu widadhafshu and half of xwaniratha when it goes in on the dark side it illumines the regions of arezahi wourubareshti wourujareshti and one half of xwaniratha when it is day here it is night there on the conflict of the creations of the world with the antagonism of the evil spirit it is said in revelation that the evil spirit even as he rushed in and looked upon the pure bravery of the angels and his own violence wished to rush back the spirit of the sky is himself like one of the warriors who has put on armor he arrayed the sky against the evil spirit and led on in the contest until ohrmazd had completed a rampart around stronger than the sky and in front of the sky and his guardian spirits farohar of warriors and the righteous on war horses and spear in hand were around the sky such-like as the hair on the head is the similitude anguni-aitak of those who hold the watch of the rampart and no passage was found by the evil spirit who rushed back and he beheld the annihilation of the demons and his own impotence as ohrmazd did his own final triumph producing the renovation of universe for ever and everlasting the second conflict was waged with the water because as the star tishtar was in cancer the water which is in the subdivision they call avrak was pouring on the same day when the destroyer rushed in and came again into notice for mischief avarak in the direction of the west for every single month is the owner of one constellation the month tir is the fourth month of the year and cancer the fourth constellation from aries so it is the owner of cancer into which tishtar sprang and displayed the characteristics of a producer of rain and he brought on the water aloft by the strength of the wind co-operators wlth tishtar were vohuman and the angel hom with the assistance of the angel burj and the righteous guardian spirits in orderly arrangement tishtar was converted into three forms the form of a man and the form of a horse and the form of a bull thirty days and nights he was distinguished in brilliance and in each form he produced rain ten days and nights as the astrologers say that every constellation has three forms every single drop of that rain became as big as a bowl and the water stood the height of a man over the whole of this earth and the noxious creatures on the earth being all killed by the rain went into the holes of the earth and afterwards the wind spirit so that it may not be contaminated gumikht stirs up the wind and atmosphere as the life stirs in the body and the water was all swept away by it and was brought out to the borders of the earth and the wide-formed ocean arose therefrom the noxious creatures remained dead within the earth and their venom and stench were mingled with the earth and in order to carry that poison away from the earth tishtar went down into the ocean in the form of a white horse with long hoofs and apaosh the demon came meeting him in the likeness of a black horse with clumsy kund hoofs a mile parasang away from him fled tishtar through the fright which drove him away and tishtar begged for success from ohrmazd and ohrmazd gave him strength and power as it is said that unto tishtar was brought at once the strength of ten vigorous horses ten vigorous camels ten vigorous bulls ten mountains and ten rivers a mile away from him fled apaosh the demon through fright at his strength on account of this they speak of an arrow-shot with tishtars strength in the sense of a mile afterwards with a cloud for a jar khumb -- thus they call the measure which was a means of the work -- he seized upon the water and made it rain most prodigiously in drops like bulls heads and mens heads pouring in handfuls and pouring in armfuls both great and small on the production of that rain the demons aspenjargak and apaosh contended with it and the fire vazisht turned its club over and owing to the blow of the club aspenjargak made a very grievous noise as even now in a conflict with the producer of rain a groaning and raging are manifest and ten nights and days rain was produced by him in that manner and the poison and venom of the noxious creatures which were in the earth were all mixed up in the water and the water became quite salt because there remained in the earth some of those germs which noxious creatures ever collect afterwards the wind in the same manner as before restrained the water at the end of three days on various sides of the earth and the three great seas and twenty-three small seas arose therefrom and two fountains chashmak of the sea thereby became manifest one the chechast lake and one the sovbar whose sources are connected with the fountain of the sea and at its north side two rivers flowed out and went one to the east and one to the west they are the arag river and the veh river as it is said thus through those finger-breadth tricklings do thou pour and draw forth two such waters o ohrmazd both those rivers wind about through all the extremities of the earth and intermingle again with the water of the wide-formed ocean as those two rivers flowed out and from the same place of origin as theirs eighteen navigable rivers flowed out and after the other waters have flowed out from those navigable streams they all flow back to the arag river and veh river whose fertilization khvapardarih of the world arises therefrom on the conflict which the evil spirit waged with the earth as the evil spirit rushed in the earth shook and the substance of mountains was created in the earth first mount alburz arose afterwards the other ranges of mountains kofaniha of the middle of the earth for as alburz grew forth all the mountains remained in motion for they have all grown forth from the root of alburz at that time they came up from the earth like a tree which has grown up to the clouds and its root to the bottom and their root passed on that way from one to the other and they are arranged in mutual connection afterwards about that wonderful shaking out from the earth they say that a great mountain is the knot of lands and the passage for the waters within the mountains is the root which is below the mountains they forsake the upper parts so that they may flow into it just as the roots of trees pass into the earth a counterpart anguni-aitak of the blood in the arteries of men which gives strength to the whole body in numbers apart from alburz all the mountains grew up out of the earth in eighteen years from which arises the perfection of mens advantage on the nature of plants the conflict waged with plants was that when they became quite dry amerodad the archangel as the vegetation was his own pounded the plants small and mixed them up with the water which tishtar seized and tishtar made that water rain down upon the whole earth on the whole earth plants grew up like hair upon the heads of men ten thousand of them grew forth of one special description for keeping away the ten-thousand species of disease which the evil spirit produced for the creatures and from those ten-thousand the species of plants have grown forth from that same germ of plants the tree of all germs was given forth and grew up in the wide-formed ocean from which the germs of all species of plants ever increased and near to that tree of all germs the gokard gokaren tree was produced for keeping away deformed dushpad decrepitude and the full perfection of the world arose therefrom on the conflict waged with the primeval ox as it passed away owing to the vegetable principle chiharak proceeding from every limb of the ox fifty-and-five species of grain and twelve species of medicinal plants grew forth from the earth and their splendour and strength were the seminal energy tokhmih of the ox delivered to the moon station that seed was thoroughly purified by the light of the moon fully prepared in every way and produced life in a body thence arose two oxen one male and one female and afterwards two hundred-and-eighty-two species of each kind became manifest upon the earth the dwelling manist of the birds is in the air and the fish are in the midst of the water on the nature of the earth it says in revelation that there are thirty and three kinds of land on the day when tishtar produced the rain when its seas arose therefrom the whole place half taken up by water was converted into seven portions this portion as much as one-half is the middle and six portions are around those six portions are together as much as khvaniras the name keshvar zone or region is also applied to them and they existed side by side kash kash as on the east side of this portion khvaniras is the savah region on the west is the arzah region the two portions on the south side are the fradadafsh and vidadafsh regions the two portions on the north side are the vorubarsht and vorujarsst regions and that in the middle is khvaniras and khvaniras has the sea for one part of the wide-formed ocean wound about around it and from vorubarsht and vorujarsht a lofty mountain grew up so that it is not possible for any one to go from region to region and of these seven regions every benefit was created most in khvaniras and the evil spirit also produced most for khvaniras on account of the superiority sarih which he saw in it for the kayanians and heroes were created in khvaniras and the good religion of the mazdayasnians was created in khvaniras and afterwards conveyed to the other regions soshyans is born in khvaniras who makes the evil spirit impotent and causes the resurrection and future existence on the nature of mountains it says in revelation that at first the mountains have grown forth in eighteen years and alburz ever grew till the completion of eight hundred years two hundred years up to the star station payak two-hundred years to the moon station two-hundred years to the sun station and two-hundred years to the endless light while the other mountains have grown out of alburz in number mountains and are hugar the lofty terak of alburz chakad-i daitik and the arezur ridge the ausindom mountain mount aparsen which they say is the mountain of pars mount zarid also which is mount manush mount airach mount kaf mount vadges mount aushdashtar mount arezur-bum mount royishn-homand mount padashkhvargar which is the greatest in khvarih the mountain which they call chino mount revand mount darspet the bakyir mountain mount kabed-shikaft mount siyak-muimand mount vafar-homand mount spendyad and kondrasp mount asnavand and kondras mount sichidav a mountain among those which are in kangdez of which they say that they are a comfort and delight of the good creator the smaller hills i will mention them also a second time alburz is around this earth and is connected with the sky the terak of alburz is that through which the stars moon and sun pass in and through it they come back hugar the lofty is that from which the water of aredvivsur leaps down the height of a thousand men the ausindom mountain is that which being of ruby khun-ahino of the substance of the sky is in the midst of the wide-formed oceanj so that its water which is from hugar pours down into it the ocean chakad-i-daitik the judicial peak is that of the middle of the world the height of a hundred men on which the cinwad bridge stands and they take account of the soul at that place the arezur ridge of the alburz mountain is a summit at the gate of hell where they always hold the concourse of the demons this also is said that excepting alburz the aparsen mountain is the greatest the aparsen mountain they call the mountain of pars and its beginning is in sagastan and its end in khujistan mount manush is great the mountain on which manushchihar was born the remaining mountains have chiefly grown from those as it is said that the elevation afsarih of the districts had arisen most around those three mountains mount airach is in the middle from hamadan to khvarizem and has grown from mount aparsen mount chino which is on its east on the frontier of turkistan is connected also with aparsen mount kaf has grown from the same mount aparsen mount aushdashtar is in sagastan mount arezhur is that which is in the direction of arum the padash-khvargar mountain is that which is in taparistan and the side of gilan the revand mountain is in khurasan on which the burzin fire was established and its name revand means this that it is glorious the vadges mountain is that which is on the frontier of the vadgesians that quarter is full of timber and full of trees the bakyir mountain is that which frasiyav of tur used as a stronghold and he made his residence within it and in the days of yim a myriad towns and cities were erected on its pleasant and prosperous territory mount kabed-shikaft very rugged is that in pars out of the same mount aparsen mount siyak-homand being black and mount vafar-homand having snow as far as their kavul borders have grown out of it aparsen towards the direction of chino the spendyad mountain is in the circuit var of revand the kondrasp mountain on the summit of which is lake sovbar is in the district or by the town of tus the kondras mountain is in airan-vej the asnavand mountain is in ataro-patakan the royishn-homand having growth mountain is that on which vegetation has grown whatever mountains are those which are in every place of the various districts and various countries and cause the tillage and prosperity therein are many in name and many in number and have grown from these same mountains as mount ganavad mount asparog mount pahargar mount dimavand mount ravak mount zarin mount gesbakht mount davad mount mijin and mount marak which have all grown from mount aparsen of which the other mountains are enumerated for the davad mountain has grown into khujistan likewise from the aparsen mountain the dimavand mountain is that in which bevarasp is bound from the same padashkh-vargar mountain unto mount kumish which they call mount madofryad come-to-help -- that in which vistasp routed arjasp -- is mount miyan-i-dast mid-plain and was broken off from that mountain there they say in the war of the religion when there was confusion among the iranians it broke off from that mountain and slid down into the middle of the plain the iranians were saved by it and it was called come-to-help by them the ganavad mountain is likewise there on the ridge of vishtasp pusht-i vishtaspan at the abode of the burzin-mitro fire nine leagues parasang to the west ravak bishan is in zravakad this place some say is zravad some call it bishan some kalak from this the road of two sides of the mountain is down the middle of a fortress for this reason that is because it is there formed they call kalak a fortress this place they also call within the land of sarak mount asparog is established from the country of lake chechast unto pars pahargar the pahar range is in khurasan mount marak is in laran mount zarin is in turkistan mount bakht-tan is in spahan the rest apart from this enumeration which they reckon as fostering hills of the country in the religion of the mazdayasnians are the small hills those which have grown piecemeal in places on the nature of seas it says in revelation that the wide-formed ocean keeps one-third of this earth on the south side of the border of alburz and so wide-formed is the ocean that the water of a thousand lakes is held by it such as the source aredvivsur which some say is the fountain lake every particular lake is of a particular kind some are great and some are small some are so large that a man with a horse might compass them around in forty days which is leagues parasang in extent through the warmth and clearness of the water purifying more than other waters everything continually flows from the source aredvivsur at the south of mount alburz a hundred-thousand golden channels are there formed and that water goes with warmth and clearness tkrough the channels on to hugar the lofty on the summit of that mountain is a lake into that lake it flows becomes quite purified and comes back through a different golden channel at the height of a thousand men an open golden branch from that channel is connected with mount ausindom amid the wide-formed ocean from there one portion flows forth to the ocean for the purification of the sea and one portion drizzles in moisture upon the whole of this earth and all the creations of ohrmazd acquire health from it and it dispels the dryness of the atmosphere of the salt seas three are principal and twenty-three are small of the three which are principal one is the putik one the kamrud and one the shahi-bun of all three the putik is the largest in which is a flow and ebb on the same side as the wide-formed ocean and it is joined to the wide-formed ocean amid this wide-formed ocean on the putik side it has a sea which they call the gulf var of sataves thick and salt the stench wishes to go from the sea putik to the wide-formed ocean with a mighty high wind therefrom the gulf of sataves drives away whatever is stench and whatever is pure and clean goes into the wide-formed ocean and the source aredvivsur and that flows back a second time to putik the control of this sea the putik is connected with the moon and wind it comes again and goes down in increase and decrease because of her revolving the control also of the gulf of sataves is attached to the constellation sataves in whose protection are the seas of the southern quarter just as those on the northern side are in the protection of haptoring concerning the flow and ebb it is said that everywhere from the presence of the moon two winds continually blow whose abode is in the gulf of sataves one they call the down-draught and one the up-draught when the up-draught blows it is the flow and when the down-draught blows it is the ebb in the other seas there is nothing of the nature of a revolution of the moon therein and there are no flow and ebb the sea of kamrud is that which they pass by in the north in taparistan that of shahi-bun is in arum of the small seas that which was most wholesome was the sea kyansih such as is in sagastan at first noxious creatures snakes and lizards vazagh were not in it and the water was sweeter than in any of the other seas later dadigar it became salt at the closest on account of the stench it is not possible to go so near as one league so very great are the stench and saltness through the violence of the hot wind when the renovation of the universe occurs it will again become sweet on the nature of the five classes of animals gospend it says in revelation that when the primeval ox passed away there where the marrow came out grain grew up of fifty-and-five species and twelve species of medicinal plants grew as it says that out of the marrow is every separate creature every single thing whose lodgment is in the marrow from the horns arose peas mijuk from the nose the leek from the blood the grapevine from which they make wine -- on this account wine abounds with blood -- from the lungs the rue-like herbs from the middle of the heart thyme for keeping away stench and every one of the others as revealed in the avesta the seed of the ox was carried up to the moon station there it was thoroughly purified and produced the manifold species of animals first two oxen one male and one female and afterwards one pair of every single species was let go into the earth and was discernible in eranvej for a hasar mile which is like a parasang league as it says that on account of the value of the ox it was created twice one time as an ox and one time as the manifold species of animals a thousand days and nights they were without eating and first water and afterwards herbage aurvar were devoured by them and afterwards the three classes kardak of animals were produced therefrom as it says that first were the goat and sheep and then the camel and swine and then the horse and ass for first those suitable for grazing were created therefrom those are now kept in the valley lai the second created were those of the hill summits sar-i dez which are wide-travelers and habits nihadak are not taught to them by hand the third created were those dwelling in the water as for the genera khadunak the first genus is that which has the foot cloven in two and is suitable for grazing of which a camel larger than a horse is small and new-born the second genus is ass-footed of which the swift horse is the largest and the ass the least the third genus is that of the five-dividing paw of which the dog is the largest and the civet-cat the least the fourth genus is the flying of which the griffin of three natures is the largest and the chaffinch the least the fifth genus is that of the water of which the kar fish is the largest and the nemadu the least these five genera are apportioned out into two hundred-and-eighty-two species sardak first are five species of goat the ass-goat the milch-goat the mountain-goat the fawn and the common goat second five species of sheep that with a tail that which has no tail the dog-sheep the wether and the kurishk sheep a sheep whose horn is great it possesses a grandeur like unto a horse and they use it mostly for a steed bara as it is said that manuschihar kept a kurishk as a steed third two species of camel the mountain one and that suitable for grazing for one is fit to keep in the mountain and one in the plain they are one-humped and two-humped fourth fifteen species of ox the white mud-colored red yellow black and dappled the elk the buffalo the camel-leopard ox the fish-chewing ox the fars ox the kajau and other species of ox fifth eight species of horse the arab the persian the mule the ass the wild ass gor the hippopotamus asp-i avi and other species of horse sixth ten species of dog the shepherds dog the village-dog which is the house-protector the blood-hound the slender hound the water-beaver which they call the water-dog the fox the ichneumon rasu the hedgehog which they call thorny-back the porcupine and the civet-cat of which two species are those accustomed to burrows one the fox and one the ichneumon and those accustomed to jungle are such as the porcupine which has spines on its back and the hedgehog which is similar seventh five species of the black hare two are wild species one dwelling in a burrow and one dwelling in the jungle eighth eight species of weasel one the marten one the black marten the squirrel the bez ermine the white ermine and other species of weasel ninth eight species of musk animals one is that which is recognized by its musk one the musk animal with a bag in which is their pleasant scent the bish-musk which eats the bish-herb the black musk which is the enemy of the serpent that is numerous in rivers and other species of musk animals tenth one-hundred-and-ßten species of birds flying creatures veyvai such as the griffin bird the karshipt the eagle the kahrkas which they call the vulture the crow the arda the crane and the tenth is the bat there are two of them which have milk in the teat and suckle their young the griffin bird and the bat which flies in the night as they say that the bat is created of three races sardak the race ayina of the dog the bird and the musk animal for it flies like a bird has many teeth like a dog and is dwelling in holes like a musk-rat these hundred-and-ten species of birds are distributed into eight groups khaduinak mostly as scattered about as when a man scatters seed and drops the seed in his fingers to the ground large middling and small eleventh fish were created of ten species first the fish arizh the arzuva the arzuka the marzuka and other avesta names afterwards within each species species within species are created so the total is two-hundred-and-eighty-two species of the dog they say that out of the star station that is away from the direction of the constellation haptoring was given to him further by a stage yojist than to men on account of his protection of sheep and as associating with sheep and men for this the dog is purposely adapted as three more kinds of advantage are given to him than to man he has his own boots his own clothing and may wander about without self-exertion the twelfth is the sharp-toothed beast of which the leader of the flock is in such great fear for that flock of sheep is very badly maintained which has no dog ohrmazd said when the bird varesha was created by him which is a bird of prey thus thou art created by me o bird varesha so that my vexation may be greater than my satisfaction with thee for thou doest the will of the evil spirit more than that of me like the wicked man who did not become satiated with wealth thou also dost not become satiated with the slaughter of birds but if thou be not created by me o bird varesha thou wouldst be created by him the evil spirit as a kite with the body of a varpa by which no creature would be left alive many animals are created in all these species for this reason that when one shall be perishing through the evil spirit one shall remain on the nature of men it says in revelation that gayomard in passing away gave forth seed that seed was thoroughly purified by the motion of the light of the sun and neryosang kept charge of two portions and spandarmad received one portion and in forty years with the shape of a one-stemmed rivas-plant and the fifteen years of its fifteen leaves matro mashye and matroyao mashyane grew up from the earth in such a manner that their arms rested behind on their shoulders dosh and one joined to the other they were connected together and both alike and the waists of both of them were brought close and so connected together that it was not clear which is the male and which the female and which is the one whose living soul nismo of ohrmazd is not away as it is said thus which is created before the soul nismo or the body and ohrmazd said that the soul is created before and the body after for him who was created it is given into the body that it may produce activity and the body is created only for activity hence the conclusion is this that the soul ruban is created before and the body after and both of them changed from the shape of a plant into the shape of man and the breath nismo went spiritually into them which is the soul ruban and now moreover in that similitude a tree had grown up whose fruit was the ten varieties of man ohrmazd spoke to mashye and mashyane thus you are man you are the ancestry of the world and you are created perfect in devotion by me perform devotedly the duty of the law think good thoughts speak good words do good deeds and worship no demons both of them first thought this that one of them should please the other as he is a man for him and the first deed done by them was this when they went out they washed themselves thoroughly and the first words spoken by them were these that ohrmazd created the water and earth plants and animals the stars moon and sun and all prosperity whose origin and effect are from the manifestation of righteousness and afterwards antagonism rushed into their minds and their minds were thoroughly corrupted and they exclaimed that the evil spirit created the water and earth plants and animals and the other things as aforesaid that false speech was spoken through the will of the demons and the evil spirit possessed himself of this first enjoyment from them through that false speech they both became wicked and their souls are in hell until the future existence and they had gone thirty days without food covered with clothing of herbage giyah and after the thirty days they went forth into the wilderness came to a white-haired goat and milked the milk from the udder with their mouths when they had devoured the milk mashye said to mashyane thus my delight was owing to it when i had not devoured the milk and my delight is more delightful now when it is devoured by my vile body that second false speech enhanced the power of the demons and the taste of the food was taken away by them so that out of a hundred parts one part remained afterwards in another thirty days and nights they came to a sheep fat and white-jawed and they slaughtered it and fire was extracted by them out of the wood of the lote-plum and box-tree through the guidance of the heavenly angels since both woods were most productive of fire for them and the fire was stimulated by their mouths and the first fuel kindled by them was dry grass kendar lotos date palm leaves and myrtle and they made a roast of the sheep and they dropped three handfuls of the meat into the fire and said this is the share of the fire one piece of the rest they tossed to the sky and said this is the share of the angels a bird the vulture advanced and carried some of it away from before them as a dog ate the first meat and first a clothing of skins covered them afterwards it is said woven garments were prepared from a cloth woven in the wilderness and they dug out a pit in the earth and iron was obtained by them and beaten out with a stone and without a forge they beat out a cutting edge from it and they cut wood with it and prepared a wooden shelter from the sun pesh-khur owing to the gracelessness which they practiced the demons became more oppressive and they themselves carried on unnatural malice between themselves they advanced one against the other and smote and tore their hair and cheeks then the demons shouted out of the darkness thus you are man worship the demon so that your demon of malice may repose mashye went forth and milked a cows milk and poured it out towards the northern quarter through that the demons became more powerful and owing to them they both became so dry-backed that in fifty winters they had no desire for intercourse and though they had had intercourse they would have had no children and on the completion of fifty years the source of desire arose first in mashye and then in mashyane for mashye said to mashyane thus when i see thy shame my desires arise then mashyane spoke thus brother mashye when i see thy great desire i am also agitated afterwards it became their mutual wish that the satisfaction of their desires should be accomplished as they reflected thus our duty even for those fifty years was this from them was born in nine months a pair male and female and owing to tenderness for offspring the mother devoured one and the father one and afterwards ohrmazd took tenderness for offspring away from them so that one may nourish a child and the child may remain and from them arose seven pairs male and female and each was a brother and sister-wife and from every one of them in fifty years children were born and they themselves died in a hundred years of those seven pairs one was siyamak the name of the man and nasak of the woman and from them a pair was born whose names were fravak of the man and fravakain of the woman from them fifteen pairs were born every single pair of whom became a race sardak and from them the constant continuance of the generations of the world arose owing to the increase zayishn of the whole fifteen races nine races proceeded on the back of the ox sarsaok through the wide-formed ocean to the other six regions karshwar and stayed there and six races of men remained in xwaniratha of those six races the name of the man of one pair was tazh and of the woman tazhak and they went to the plain of the tazhikan arabs and of one pair hooshang was the name of the man and guzhak of the woman and from them arose the airanakan iranians and from one pair the mazendarans have arisen among the number pavan ae mar were those who are in the countries of surak those who are in the country of aner those who are in the countries of tur those who are in the country of salm which is arum those who are in the country of seni that which is chinistan those who are in the country of dai and those who are in the country of sind those indeed throughout the seven regions are all from the lineage of fravak son of siyamak son of mashye as there were ten varieties of man and fifteen races from fravak there were twenty-five races all from the seed of gayomard the varieties are such as those of the earth of the water the breast-eared the breast-eyed the one-legged those also who have wings like a bat those of the forest with tails and who have hair on the body on the nature of generation it says in revelation that a woman when she comes out from menstruation during ten days and nights when they go near unto her soon becomes pregnant when she is cleansed from her menstruation and when the time for pregnancy has come always when the seed of the man is the more powerful a son arises from it when that of the woman is the more powerful a daughter when both seeds are equal twins and triplets if the male seed comes the sooner it adds to the female and she becomes robust if the female seed comes the sooner it becomes blood and the leanness of the female arises therefrom the female seed is cold and moist and its flow is from the loins and the color is white red and yellow and the male seed is hot and dry its flow is from the brain of the head and the color is white and mud-colored hashgun all the seed of the females which issues beforehand takes a place within the womb and the seed of the males will remain above it and will fill the space of the womb whatever refrains therefrom becomes blood again enters into the veins of the females and at the time any one is born it becomes milk and nourishes him as all milk arises from the seed of the males and the blood is that of the females these four things they say are male and these female the sky metal wind and fire are male and are never otherwise the water earth plants and fish are female and are never otherwise the remaining creation consists of male and female as regards the fish it says that at the time of excitement they go forwards and come back in the water two and two the length of a mile hasar which is one-fourth of a league parasang in the running water in that coming and going they then rub their bodies together and a kind of sweat drops out betwixt them and both become pregnant on the nature of fire it says in revelation that fire is produced of five kinds namely the fire berezi-savang the fire which shoots up before ohrmazd the lord the fire vohu-fryan the fire which is in the bodies of men and animals the fire urvazisht the fire which is in plants the fire vazisht the fire which is in a cloud which stands opposed to spenjargak in conflict the fire spenisht the fire which they keep in use in the world likewise the fire of warharan of those five fires one consumes both water and food as that which is in the bodies of men one consumes water and consumes no food as that which is in plants which live and grow through water one consumes food and consumes no water as that which they keep in use in the world and likewise the fire of warharan one consumes no water and no food as the fire vazisht the berezi-savang is that in the earth and mountains and other things which ohrmazd created in the original creation like three breathing souls nismo through the watchfulness and protection due to them the world ever develops vakhshed and in the reign of tahmurasp when men continually passed on the back of the ox sarsaok from xwaniratha to the other regions one night amid the sea the wind rushed upon the fireplace -- the fireplace in which the fire was such as was provided in three places on the back of the ox -- which the wind dropped with the fire into the sea and all those three fires like three breathing souls continually shot up in the place and position of the fire on the back of the ox so that it becomes quite light and the men pass again through the sea and in the reign of yim jamshed every duty was performed more fully through the assistance of all those three fires and the fire adar farnbag was established by him at the appointed place dadgah on the gadman-homand glorious mountain in khvarizem which yim jamshed constructed for them and the glory of yim jamshed saves the fire adar farnbag from the hand of dahak zohak in the reign of king vishtasp upon revelation from the religion it was established out of khvarizem at the roshan shining mountain in kavulistan the country of kabul kabul just as it remains there even now the fire adar gushnasp until the reign of kay khosraw continually afforded the world protection in the manner aforesaid and when kay khosraw was extirpating the idol-temples of lake chechast it settled upon the mane of his horse and drove away the darkness and gloom and made it quite light so that they might extirpate the idol-temples in the same locality the fire adar gushnasp was established at the appointed place on the asnavand mountain the fire adar burzin mihr until the reign of king vishtasp ever assisted in like manner in the world and continually afforded protection and when the glorified zartosht was introduced to produce confidence in the progress of the religion king vishtasp and his offspring were steadfast in the religion of god and vishtasp established this fire at the appointed place on mount revand where they say the ridge of vishtasp pusht-i vishtaspan is all those three fires are the whole body of the fire of warharan together with the fire of the world and those breathing souls are lodged in them a counterpart of the body of man when it forms in the womb of the mother and a soul from the spirit-world settles within it which controls the body while living when that body dies the body mingles with the earth and the soul goes back to the spirit on the nature of the tree they call gokaren it says in revelation that it was the first day when the tree they call gokaren grew in the deep mud within the wide-formed ocean and it is necessary as a producer of the renovation of the universe for they prepare its immortality therefrom the evil spirit has formed therein among those which enter as opponents a lizard as an opponent in that deep water so that it may injure the haoma and for keeping away that lizard ohrmazd has created there ten kar fish which at all times continually circle around the haoma so that the head of one of those fish is continually towards the lizard and together with the lizard those fish are spiritually fed that is no food is necessary for them and till the renovation of the universe they remain in contention there are places where that fish is written of as the ariz of the water as it says that the greatest of the creatures of ohrmazd is that fish and the greatest of those proceeding from the evil spirit is that lizard with the jaws of their bodies moreover they snap in two whatever of the creatures of both spirits has entered between them except that one fish which is the vas of panchasadvaran this too is said that those fish are so serpent-like in that deer water they know the scratch malishn of a needles point by which the water shall increase or by which it is diminishing regarding the vas of panchasadvaran it is declared that it moves within the wide-formed ocean and its length is as much as what a man while in a swift race will walk from dawn till when the sun goes down so much that it does not itself move the length of the whole of its great body this too is said that the creatures of the waters live also specially under its guardianship the tree of many seeds has grown amid the wide-formed ocean and in its seed are all plants some say it is the proper-curing some the energetic-curing some the all-curing between these trees of such kinds is formed the mountain with cavities thousand myriads in number each myriad being ten-thousand unto that mountain is given the protection of the waters so that water streams forth from there in the rivulet channels to the land of the seven regions as the source of all the sea-water in the land of the seven regions is from there regarding the three-legged ass they say that it stands amid the wide-formed ocean and its feet are three eyes six mouths nine ears two and horn one body white food spiritual and it is righteous and two of its six eyes are in the position of eyes two on the top of the head and two in the position of the hump with the sharpness of those six eyes it overcomes and destroys of the nine mouths three are in the head three in the hump and three in the inner part of the flanks and each mouth is about the size of a cottage and if is itself as large as mount alvand each one of the three feet when it is placed on the ground is as much as a flock gird of a thousand sheep comes under when they repose together and each pastern is so great in its circuit that a thousand men with a thousand horses may pass inside as for the two ears it is mazendaran which they will encompass the one horn is as it were of gold and hollow and a thousand branch horns have grown upon it some befitting a camel some befitting a horse some befitting an ox some befitting an ass both great and small with that horn it will vanquish and dissipate all the vile corruption due to the efforts of noxious creatures when that ass shall hold its neck in the ocean its ears will terrify asahmed and all the water of the wide-formed ocean will shake with agitation and the side of ganavad will tremble shivaned when it utters a cry all female water-creatures of the creatures of ohrmazd will become pregnant and all pregnant noxious water-creatures when they hear that cry will cast their young when it stales in the ocean all the sea-water will become purified which is in the seven regions of the earth -- it is even on that account when all asses which come into water stale in the water -- as it says thus if o three-legged ass you were not created for the water all the water in the sea would have perished from the contamination which the poison of the evil spirit has brought into its water through the death of the creatures of ohrmazd tishtar seizes the water more completely from the ocean with the assistance of the three-legged ass of ambergris also ambar-ich it is declared that it is the dung of the three-legged ass for if it has much spirit food then also the moisture of the liquid nourishment goes through the veins pertaining to the body into the urine and the dung is cast away of the ox hadhayosh which they call sarsaok it says that in the original creation men passed from region to region upon it and in the renovation of the universe they prepare hush the beverage producing immortality from it it is said that life is in the hand of that foremost man at the end of his years who has constructed the most defenses around this earth until the renovation of the universe is requisite regarding the bird chamrosh it says that it is on the summit of mount alburz and every three years many come from the non-iranian districts for booty gird by going to bring damage ziyan on the iranian districts and to effect the devastation of the world then the angel burj having come up from the low country of lake arag arouses that very bird chamrosh and it flies upon the loftiest of all the lofty mountains and picks up all those non-iranian districts as a bird does corn regarding karshipt they say that it knew how to speak words and brought the religion to the enclosure which yim jamshed made and circulated it there they utter the avesta in the language of birds regarding the ox-fish they say that it exists in all seas when it utters a cry all fish become pregnant and all noxious water-creatures cast their young the griffin bird which is a bat is noticed kard twice in another baba regarding the bird ashozusht which is the bird zobara-vahman and also the bird shok they say that it has given an avesta with its tongue when it speaks the demons tremble at it and take nothing away there a nail-paring when it is not prayed over afsud the demons and wizards seize and like an arrow it shoots at and kills that bird on this account the bird seizes and devours a nail-paring when it is prayed over so that the demons may not control its use when it is not prayed over it does not devour it and the demons are able to commit an offense with it also other beasts and birds are created all in opposition to noxious creatures as it says that when the birds and beasts are all in opposition to noxious creatures and wizards c this too it says that of all precious birds the crow valagh is the most precious regarding the white falcon it says that it kills the serpent with wings the magpie kaskinak bird kills the locust and is created in opposition to it the kahrkas dwelling in decay which is the vulture is created for devouring dead matter nasai so also are the crow valak and the mountain kite the mountain ox the mountain goat the deer the wild ass and other beasts devour all snakes so also of other animals dogs are created in opposition to the wolf species and for securing the protection of sheep the fox is created in opposition to the demon khava the ichneumon is created in opposition to the venomous snake garzhak and other noxious creatures in burrows so also the great musk-animal is created in opposition to ravenous intestinal worms kaduk-danak garzhak the hedgehog is created in opposition to the ant which carries off grain as it says that the hedgehog every time that it voids urine into an ants nest will destroy a thousand ants when the grain-carrier travels over the earth it produces a hollow track when the hedgehog travels over it the track goes away from it and it becomes level the water-beaver is created in opposition to the demon which is in the water the conclusion is this that of all beasts and birds and fishes every one is created in opposition to some noxious creature regarding the vulture karkas it says that even from his highest flight he sees when flesh the size of a fist is on the ground and the scent of musk is created under his wing so that if in devouring dead matter the stench of the dead matter comes out from it he puts his head back under the wing and is comfortable again regarding the arab horse they say that if in a dark night a single hair occurs on the ground he sees it the cock is created in opposition to demons and wizards cooperating with the dog as it says in revelation that of the creatures of the world those which are cooperating with srosh in destroying the fiends are the cock and the dog this too it says that it would not have been managed if i had not created the shepherds dog which is the pasush-haurva and the house watch-dog the vish-haurva for it says in revelation that the dog is a destroyer of such a fiend as covetousness among those which are in the nature aitih of man and of animals moreover it says that inasmuch as it will destroy all the disobedient when it barks it will destroy pain and its flesh and fat are remedies for driving away decay and pain from men ohrmazd created nothing useless whatever for all these kola ae are created for advantage when one does not understand the reason of them it is necessary to ask the dastur high-priest for his five dispositions khuk are created in this way that he may continually destroy the fiend or deceit on the nature of rivers it says in revelation that these two rivers flow forth from the north part from alburz and part from the alburz of ohrmazd one towards the west that is the arag and one towards the east that is the veh river after them eighteen rivers flowed forth from the same source just as the remaining waters have flowed forth from them in great multitude as they say that they flowed out so very fast one from the other as when a man recites one ashem-vohu of a series padisar all of those with the same water are again mingled with these rivers that is the arag river and veh river both of them continually circulate through the two extremities of the earth and pass into the sea and all the regions feast owing to the discharge zahak of both which after both arrive together at the wide-formed ocean returns to the sources whence they flowed out as it says in revelation that just as the light comes in through alburz and goes out through alburz the water also comes out through alburz and goes away through alburz this too it says that the spirit of the arag begged of ohrmazd thus o first omniscient creative power from whom the veh river begged for the welfare that thou mightiest grant do thou then grant it in my quantity the spirit of the veh river similarly begged of ohrmazd for the arag river and on account of loving assistance one towards the other they flowed forth with equal strength as before the coming of the destroyer they proceeded without rapids and when the fiend shall be destroyed they will again be without rapids of those eighteen principal rivers distinct from the arag river and veh river and the other rivers which flow out from them i will mention the more famous the arag river the veh river the diglat river they call also again the veh river the frat river the daitya river the dargam river the zondak river the haroi river the marv river the hetumand river the akhoshir river the navada river the zishmand river the khvejand river the balkh river the mehrva river they call the hendva river the sped river the rad river which they call also the koir the khvarae river which they call also the mesrgan the harhaz river the teremet river the khvanaidis river the daraja river the kasik river the shed shining river peda-meyan or chatru-meyan river of mokarstan i will mention them also a second time the arag river is that of which it is said that it comes out from alburz in the land of surak in which they call it also the ami it passes on through the land of spetos which they also call mesr and they call it there the river niv the veh river passes on in the east goes through the land of sind and flows to the sea in hindustan and they call it there the mehra river the sources of the frat river are from the frontier of arum they feed upon it in suristan and it flows to the diglat river and of this frat it is that that they produce irrigation over the land it is declared that manuschihar excavated the sources and cast back the water all to one place as it says thus i reverence the frat full of fish which manuschihar excavated for the benefit of his own soul and he seized the water and gave to drink the diglat river comes out from salman and flows to the sea in khujistan the daitya river is the river which comes out from eranvej and goes out through the hill-country of all rivers the noxious creatures in it are most as it says that the daitya river is full of noxious creatures the dargam river is in sude the zend river passes through the mountains of panjistan and flows away to the haro river the haro river flows out from the aparsen range the hetumand river is in sagastan and its sources are from the aparsen range this is distinct from that which frasiyav conducted away the river akhoshir is in kumish the zishmand river in the direction of soghd flows away towards the khvejand river the khvejand river goes on through the midst of samarkand and pargana and they call it also the river ashard the marv river a glorious river in the east flows out from the aparsen range the balkh river comes out from the aparsen mountain of bamikan and flows on to the veh river the sped river is in ataro-patakan they say that dahak zohak begged a favor here from ahriman and the demons the tort river which they call also the koir comes out from the sea of giklan and flows to the sea of vergan the zahavayi is the river which comes out from ataro-patakan and flows to the sea in pars the sources of the khvarae river are from spahan it passes on through khujistan flows forth to the diglat river and in spahan they call it the mesrkan river the harhaz river is in taparistan and its sources are from mount damawand the teremet river flows away to the veh river the vendesesh river is in that part of pars which they call sagastan the kasak river comes out through a ravine kaf in the province of tus and they call it there the kasp river more- over the river which is there the veh they call the kasak even in sind they call it the kasak the pedak-miyan which is the river chatru-miyan is that which is in kangdez the daraja river is in eranvej on the bank bar of which was the dwelling of pourushasp the father of zartosht the other innumerable waters and rivers springs and channels are one in origin with those so in various districts and various places they call them by various names regarding frasiyav they say that a thousand springs were conducted away by him into the sea kyansih suitable for horses suitable for camels suitable for oxen suitable for asses both great and small and he conducted the spring zarinmand or golden source which is the hetumand river they say into the same sea and he conducted the seven navigable waters of the source of the vachaeni river into the same sea and made men settle there in revelation they mention seventeen species of liquid maya as one liquid resides in plants second that which is flowing from the mountains that is the rivers third that which is rain-water fourth that of tanks and other special constructions fifth the semen of animals and men sixth the urine of animals and men seventh the sweat of animals and men the eighth liquid is that in the skin of animals and men ninth the tears of animals and men tenth the blood of animals and men eleventh the oil in animals and men a necessary in both worlds twelfth the saliva of animals and men with which they nourish the embryo the thirteenth is that which is under the bark of plants as it is said that every bark has a liquid through which a drop appears on a twig tekh when placed four finger-breadths before a fire fourteenth the milk of animals and men all these through growth or the body which is formed mingle again with the rivers for the body which is formed and the growth are both one this too they say that of these three rivers that is the arag river the marv river and the veh river the spirits were dissatisfied so that they would not flow into the world owing to the defilement of stagnant water armesht which they beheld so that they were in tribulation through it until zartosht was exhibited to them whom i ohrmazd will create who will pour six-fold holy-water zor into it and make it again wholesome he will preach carefulness this too it says that of water whose holy-water is more and pollution less the holy-water has come in excess and in three years it goes back to the sources that of which the pollution and holy-water have both become equal arrives back in six years that of which the pollution is more and holy-water less arrives back in nine years so also the growth of plants is connected in this manner strongly with the root so likewise the blessings afrin which the righteous utter come back in this proportion to themselves regarding the river nahvtak it says that frasiyav of tur conducted it away and when ushedar comes it will flow again suitable for horses so also will the fountains of the sea kyansih kyansih is the one where the home jinak of the kayanian race is on the nature of lakes it says in revelation that thus many fountains of waters have come into notice which they call lakes var counterparts of the eyes chashm of men are those fountains chashmak of waters such as lake chechast lake sovbar lake khvarizhem lake frazdan lake zarinmand lake asvast lake husru lake sataves lake urvis i will mention them also a second time lake chechast is in ataro-patakan warm is the water and opposed to harm so that nothing whatever is living in it and its source is connected with the wide-formed ocean lake sovbar is in the upper district and country on the summit of the mountain of tus as it says that the sud-bahar share of benefit is propitious and good from which abounding liberality is produced regarding lake khvarizhem it says that excellent benefit is produced from it that is arshishang the rich in wealth the well-portioned with abounding pleasure lake frazdan is in sagastan they say where a generous man who is righteous throws anything into it it receives it when not righteous it throws it out again its source also is connected with the wide-formed ocean lake zarinmand is in hamadan regarding lake asvast it is declared that the undefiled water which it contains is always constantly flowing into the sea so bright and copious that one might say that the sun had come into it and looked at lake asvast into that water which is requisite for restoring the dead in the renovation of the universe lake husru is within fifty leagues parasang of lake chechast lake or rather gulf sataves is that already written about between the wide-formed ocean and the putik it is said that in kamindan is an abyss zafar from which everything they throw in always comes back and it will not receive it unless alive janvar when they throw a living creature into it it carries it down men say that a fountain from hell is in it lake urvis is on hugar the lofty on the nature of the ape and the bear they say that yim jamshed when reason nismo departed from him for fear of the demons took a demoness as wife and gave yimak who was his sister to a demon as wife and from them have originated the tailed ape and bear and other species of degeneracy this too they say that in the reign of azi dahak zohak a young woman was admitted to a demon and a young man was admitted to a witch pairika and on seeing them they had intercourse owing to that one intercourse the arose from them when faridoon came to them they fled from the country of iran and settled upon the sea-coast now through the invasion of the arabs they are again diffused through the country of iran the chieftainship of people and animals on the chieftainship of men and animals and every single thing it says in revelation that first of the human species gayomard was produced brilliant and white with eyes which looked out for the great one him who was here the zarathushtrotema chief high-priest the chieftainship of all things was from zartosht the white ass-goat which holds its head down is the chief of goats the first of those species created the black sheep which is fat and white-jawed is the chief of sheep it was the first of those species created the camel with white-haired knees and two humps is the chief of camels first the black-haired ox with yellow knees was created he is the chief of oxen first the dazzling white arus horse with yellow ears glossy hair and white eyes was produced he is the chief of horses the white cat-footed ass is the chief of asses first of dogs the fair arus dog with yellow hair was produced he is the chief of dogs the hare was produced brown bur he is the chief of the wide-travelers those beasts which have no dread whatever of the hand are evil first of birds the griffin of three natures was created not for here this world for the karshipt is the chief which they call the falcon chark that which revelation says was brought to the enclosure formed by yim jamshed first of fur animals the white ermine was produced he is the chief of fur animals as it says that it is the white ermine which came unto the assembly of the archangels the kar-fish or arizh is the chief of the water-creatures the daitya river is the chief of streams the daraja river is the chief of exalted rivers for the dwelling of the father of zartosht was on its banks and zartosht was born there the hoary forest is the chief of forests hugar the lofty on which the water of aredvisur flows and leaps is the chief of summits since it is that above which is the revolution of the constellation sataves the chief of reservoirs the haoma which is out-squeezed is the chief of medicinal plants wheat is the chief of large-seeded grains the desert wormwood is the chief of non-medicinal plants the summer vetch which they also call pag gavirs is the chief of small-seeded grains the kusti sacred thread-girdle is the chief of clothes the bazayvana is the chief of seas of two men when they come forward together the wiser and more truthful is chief this too it says in revelation that ohrmazd created the whole material world one abode so that all may be one for there is much splendor and glory of industry in the world whatsoever he performs who practices that which is good is the value of the water of life since water is not created alike in value for the undefiled water of aredvisur is worth the whole water of the sky and earth of xwaniratha except the arag river created by ohrmazd of trees the myrtle and date on which model it is said trees were formed are worth all the trees of xwaniratha except the gokaren tree with which they restore the dead of mountains mount aparsens beginning is in sagastan and end in khujistan some say it is all the mountains of pars and is chief of all mountains except alburz of birds chamros is chief who is worth all the birds in xwaniratha except the griffin of three natures the conclusion is this that every one who performs a great duty has then much value the religious calendar on matters of religion it says in revelation thus the creatures of the world were created by me complete in three-hundred-and-sixty-five days that is the six periods of the gahambars which are completed in a year it is always necessary first to count the day and afterwards the night for first the day goes off and then the night comes on and from the season gas of maidyoshahem which is the auspicious day khwarshed of the month tishtar to the season of maidyarem which is the auspicious day warharan of the month din dae-- the shortest day -- the night increases and from the season of maidyarem to the season of maidyoshahem the night decreases and the day increases the summer day is as much as two of the shortest winter days and the winter night is as much as two of the shortest summer nights the summer day is twelve hasars the night six hasars the winter night is twelve hasars the day six a hasar being a measure of time and in like manner of land in the season of hamaspathmaidyem that is the five supplementary days at the end of the month spandarmad the day and night are again equal as from the auspicious day ohrmazd of the month frawardin to the auspicious day anagran of the month mihr is the summer of seven months so from the auspicious day ohrmazd of the month aban to the auspicious month spandarmad on to the end of the five supplementary days is the winter of five months the priest fulfills the regulation vachar about a corpse and other things by this calculation as to summer and winter in those seven months of summer the periods gas of the days and nights are five since one celebrates the rapithwin namely the period of day-break is hawan the period of midday is rapithwin the period of afternoon is uzerin when the appearance of the stars has come into the sky until midnight is the period of aiwisruthrem from midnight until the stars become imperceptible is the period of ushahin in winter are four periods for from daybreak till uzerin is all hawan and the rest as i have said and the reason of it is this that the appearance of winter is in the direction of the north where the regions wourubareshti and wourujareshti are the original dwelling of summer too is in the south where the regions fradadhafshu and widadhafshu are on the day ohrmazd of the auspicious month aban the winter acquires strength and enters into the world and the spirit of rapithwin goes from above-ground to below-ground where the spring khani of waters is and diffuses warmth and moisture in the water and so many roots of trees do not wither with cold and drought and on the auspicious day adar of the month din the winter arrives with much cold at eranvej and until the end in the auspicious month spandarmad winter advances through the whole world on this account they kindle a fire everywhere on the day adar of the month din and it forms an indication that winter has come in those five months the water of springs and conduits is all warm for rapithwin keeps warmth and moisture there and one does not celebrate the period of rapithwin as the day ohrmazd of the month frawardin advances it diminishes the strength which winter possesses and summer comes in from its own original dwelling and receives strength and dominion rapithwin comes up from below-ground and ripens the fruit of the trees on this account the water of springs is cold in summer for rapithwin is not there and those seven months one celebrates the rapithwin and summer advances through the whole earth and yet in the direction of hindustan there where the original dwelling of summer is nearer it is always neither cold nor hot for in the season which is the dominion of summer the rain always dispels most of the heat and it does not become perceptible in the winter rain does not fall and the cold does not become very perceptible in the northern direction where the preparation of winter is it is always cold for in the summer mostly on account of the more oppressive winter there it is not possible so to dispel the cold that one might make it quite warm in the middle localities the cold of winter and heat of summer both come on vehemently again the year dependent on the revolving moon is not equal to the computed year on this account for the moon returns one time in twenty-nine and one time in thirty days and there are four hours zaman more than such a one of its years as it says that every one deceives where they speak about the moon or month except when they say that it comes twice in sixty days whoever keeps the year by the revolution of the moon mingles summer with winter and winter with summer this too it says that the auspicious month frawardin the month ardwahisht and the month hordad are spring the month tishtar the month amurdad and the month shahrewar are summer the month mihr the month aban and the month adar are autumn the month din the month vohuman and the month spandarmad are winter and the sun comes from the sign khurdak of aries into which it proceeded in the beginning back to that same place in threej-hundredj-and-sixty-five days and six short times hours which are one year as every three months it the sun advances through three constellations more or less the moon comes in a hundred-andj-eighty days back to the place out of which it traveled in the beginning measuring distances a hasar on the ground is a parasang of one-thousand steps of the two feet a parasang is a measure as much as a far-seeing man may look out see a beast of burden and make known that it is black or white and the measure of a man is eight medium spans av hâthra of vd vd- tishtar yasht the statements regarding the length of a hasar are rather perplexing for we are told that it is like a parasang chap that the length of a hasar is one-fourth of a parasang chap and that a medium hasar on the ground which they also call a parasang is a thousand steps of the two feet when walking with propriety farhang-i oim-khaduk ed hosh p to reconcile these statements we must conclude that a hasar is like a parasang merely in the sense of being a long measure of distance that it is really a mille passus or mile of the romans and that it is a quarter of the actual parasang at the same time as it was usual to call a hasar by the name of a parasang we are often left in doubt whether a mile or a league is meant when a hasar or parasang is mentioned the farhang-i oim-khaduk p also mentions other measures of distance such as the tachar av tachara of two hasars the asvâst or aêast of four hasars the dashmêst av dakhshmaiti of eight hasaras and the yôjêst av yijaiasti or yujaiasti of sixteen hasars a parasang is usually from to english miles but perhaps a hasar is meant here reading vitast-i miyânak instead of vitast damânak the farhang-i oim-khaduk p mentions three kinds of spans the av vitasti vd vd of twelve finger-breadths angûst or about inches which is a full span between the thumb and little finger the one mentioned in the text the av dishti vd of ten finger-breadths or about inches which is a span between the thumb and middle finger and the av uzashti pahl lâlâ-asht of eight finger-breadths or about inches which is a span between the thumb and fore-finger the nature of plants on the nature of plants it says in revelation that before the coming of the destroyer vegetation had no thorn and bark about it and afterwards when the destroyer came it became coated with bark and thorny for antagonism mingled with every single thing owing to that cause vegetation is also much mixed with poison like bish the height of hemp kand that is poisonous for men when they eat it die in like manner even as the animals with grain of fifty-and-five species and twelve species of medicinal plants have arisen from the primeval ox ten-thousand species among the species of principal plants and a hundred-thousand species among ordinary plants have grown from all these seeds of the tree opposed to harm the many-seeded which has grown in the wide-formed ocean when the seeds of all these plants with those from the primeval ox have arisen upon it every year the bird strips that tree and mingles all the seeds in the water tishtar seizes them with the rain-water and rains them on to all regions near to that tree the white haoma the healing and undefiled has grown at the source of the water of aredvisur every one who eats it becomes immortal and they call it the gokaren tree as it is said that haoma is expelling death also in the renovation of the universe they prepare its immortality therefrom and it is the chief of plants these are as many genera of plants as exist trees and shrubs fruit-trees corn flowers aromatic herbs salads spices grass wild plants medicinal plants gum plants and all producing oil dyes and clothing i will mention them also a second time all whose fruit is not welcome as food of men and are perennial salvar as the cypress the plane the white poplar the box and others of this genus they call trees and shrubs dar va dirakht the produce of everything welcome as food of men that is perennial as the date the myrtle the lote-plum the grape the quince the apple the citron the pomegranate the peach the fig the walnut the almond and others in this genus they call fruit

various kinds of pulse vetches and others of this genus they call corn jurdak every plant with fragrant leaves which is cultivated by the hand-labor of men and is perennial hamvar they call an aromatic herb siparam whatever sweet-scented blossom arises at various seasons through the hand-labor of men or has a perennial root and blossoms in its season with new shoots and sweet-scented blossoms as the rose the narcissus the jasmine the dog-rose nestarun the tulip the colocynth kavastik the pandanus kedi the kamba the ox-eye heri the crocus the swallow-wort zarda the violet the karda and others of this genus they call a flower gul everything whose sweet-scented fruit or sweet-scented blossom arises in its season without the hand-labor of men they call a wild plant vahar or nihal whatever is welcome as food of cattle and beasts of burden they call grass giyah whatever enters into cakes pesh-parakiha they call spices avzarika whatever is welcome in eating of bread as torn shoots of the coriander water-cress kakij the leek and others of this genus they call salad terak whatever is like spinning cotton and others of this genus they call clothing plants jamak whatever lentil is greasy as sesame dushdang hemp zandak and others of this genus they call an oil-seed rokano whatever one can dye clothing with as saffron sapan-wood zachava vaha and others of this genus they call a dye-plant rag whatever root or gum or wood is scented as frankincense varasht kust sandalwood cardamom camphor orange-scented mint and others of this genus they call a scent bod whatever stickiness comes out from plants they call gummy zadak the timber which proceeds from the trees when it is either dry or wet they call wood chiba every one of all these plants which is so they call medicinal daruk the principal fruits are of thirty kinds khaduinak and ten species sardak of them are fit to eat inside and outside as the fig the apple the quince the citron the grape the mulberry the pear and others of this kind ten are fit to eat outside but not fit to eat inside as the date the peach the white apricot and others of this kind those which are fit to eat inside but not fit to eat outside are the walnut the almond the pomegranate the coconut the filbert the chestnut the pistachio nut the vargan and whatever else of this description are very remarkable this too it says that every single flower is appropriate to an angel amahraspand as the white jasmine saman is for vohuman the myrtle and jasmine yasmin are ohrmazds own the mouse-ear or sweet marjoram is ardwahists own the basil-royal is shahrewars own the musk flower is spandarmads the lily is hordads the chamba is amurdads din-pavan-adar has the orange-scented mint vadrang-bod adar has the marigold adargun the

anagran has this haoma of the angel haoma of three kinds it is concerning plants that every single kind with a drop of water on a twig teh they should hold four finger-breadths in front of the fire most of all it is the lotos kunar they speak of on the evil-doing of ahriman and the demons on the evildoing of ahriman and the demons it says in revelation that the evil which the evil spirit has produced for the creation of ohrmazd it is possible to tell by this winter and his body is that of a lizard vazagh whose place is filth kalch he does not think nor speak nor act for the welfare nadukih of the creatures of ohrmazd and his business is unmercifulness and the destruction of this welfare so that the creatures which ohrmazd shall increase he will destroy and his eyesight chashm michihsn does not refrain from doing the creatures harm as it says that ever since a creature wag created by us i who am ohrmazd have not rested at ease on account of providing protection for my own creatures and likewise not even he the evil spirit on account of contriving evil for the creatures and by their devotion to witchcraft yatuk-dinoih he seduces mankind into affection for himself and disaffection to ohrmazd so that they forsake the religion of ohrmazd and practice that of ahriman he casts this into the thoughts of men that this religion of ohrmazd is naught and it is not necessary to be steadfast in it whoever gives that man anything in whose law dad this saying is established then the evil spirit is propitiated by him that is he has acted by his pleasure the business of akoman is this that he gave vile thoughts and discord to the creatures the business of the demon andar is this that he constrains the thoughts of the creatures from deeds of virtue just like a leader who has well-constrained sardar-i khup afsardo and he casts this into the thoughts of men that it is not necessary to have the sacred shirt sudre and thread-girdle kusti the business of the demon savar that is a leader of the demons is this that is misgovernment oppressive anarchy and drunkenness the business of the demon naikiyas is this that he gives discontent to the creatures as it says that should this one give anything to those men whose opinion dad is this that it is not necessary to have the sacred shirt and thread-girdle then andar savar and naikiyas are propitiated by him the demon taprev is he who mingles poison with plants and creatures as it says thus taprev the frustrater and zairich the maker of poison all those six it is said are arch-fiends of the demons the rest are cooperating and confederate with them this too it says that should one give anything to a man who says that it is proper to have one boot and in his law walking with one boot is established then the fiend taprev is propitiated by him the demon-taromat is he who produces disobedience the demon mitrokht is the liar drojan of the evil spirit the demon arashk malice is the spiteful fiend of the evil eye theirs are the same appliances as the demon eshms as it says that seven powers are given to eshm that he may utterly destroy the creatures therewith with those seven powers he will destroy seven of the kayanian heroes in his own time but one will remain there where mitrokht falsehood arrives arashk malice becomes welcome and there where arashk is welcome eshm lays a foundation and there where eshm has a foundation many creatures perish and he causes much non-iranianism eshm mostly contrives all evil for the creatures of ohrmazd and the evil deeds of those kayanian heroes have been more complete through eshm as it says that eshm the impetuous assailant causes them most the demon vizaresh is he who struggles with the souls of men which have departed those days and nights when they remain in the world he carries them on terror-stricken and sits at the gate of hell the demon uda is he who when a man sits in a private place or when he eats at meals strikes his knee spiritually on his back so that he bawls out and looks out that chattering he may eat chattering he may evacuate ried and chattering he may make water mezed so that he may not attain unto the best existence the demon akatash is the fiend of perversion nikirayih who makes the creatures averse nikirai from proper things as it says that whoever has given anything to that person tanu whose opinion dad is this that it is not necessary to have a high-priest dastur then the demon eshm is propitiated by him whoever has given anything to that person whose opinion is this and who says that it is not necessary to have a snake-killer mar-van then ahriman with the foregoing demons is propitiated by him this is said of him who when he sees a noxious creature does not kill it a snake-killer maro-gno is a stick on the end of which a leather thong is provided and it is declared that every one of the good religion must possess one that they may strike and kill noxious creatures and sinners more meritoriously with it zarman is the demon who makes decrepit dushpad whom they call old age pirih chishmak is he who makes disastrous vazandak and also causes the whirlwind which passes over for disturbance the demon vareno is he who causes illicit intercourse as it says thus vareno the defiling alai the demon bushasp is she who causes slothfulness sej is the fiend druj who causes annihilation and the demon niyaz is he who causes distress the demon az greediness is he who swallows everything and when through destitution nothing has come he eats himself he is that fiendishness which although the whole wealth of the world be given up to it does not fill up and is not satisfied as it says that the eye of the covetous is a noose gamand and in it the world is naught push is the demon who makes a hoard and does not consume it and does not give to any one as it says that the power of the demon az is owing to that person who not content with his own wife snatches away even those of others the demon nas is he who causes the pollution and contamination nisrushtih which they call nasai dead matter the demon friftar deceiver is he who seduces mankind the demon spazg slander is he who brings and conveys discourse milaya and it is nothing in appearance such as he says and he shows that mankind fights and apologizes avakhshined individual with individual the demon arast untrue is he who speaks falsehood the demon aighash is the malignant-eyed fiend who smites mankind with his eye the demon but is he whom they worship among the hindus and his growth is lodged in idols as one worships the horse as an idol astwihad is the evil flyer vae-i saritar who seizes the life as it says that when his hand strokes a man it is lethargy when he casts it on the sick one it is fever when he looks in his eyes he drives away the life and they call it death the demon of the malignant eye sur-chashmih is he who will spoil anything which men see when they do not say in the name of god yazdan with every one of them are many demons and fiends cooperating to specify whom a second time would be tedious demons too who are furies khashmakan are in great multitude it is said they are demons of ruin pain and growing old zvaran producers of vexation and bile revivers of grief nivagih the progeny of gloom and bringers of stench decay and vileness who are many very numerous and very notorious and a portion of all of them is mingled in the bodies of men and their characteristics are glaring in mankind the demon apaosh and the demon aspenjargak are those who remain in contest with the rain of the evil spirit are the law of vileness the religion of sorcery the weapons of fiendishness and the perversion khamih of gods works and his wish is this that is do not ask about me and do not understand me for if ye ask about and understand me ye will not come after me this too it says that the evil spirit remains at the distance of a cry even at the cry of a three-year-old cock kuleng even at the cry of an ass even at the cry of a righteous man when one strikes him involuntarily and he utters a cry the demon kundak is he who is the steed barak of wizards various new demons arise from the various new sins the creatures may commit and are produced for such purposes who make even those planets rush on which are in the celestial sphere and they stand very numerously in the conflict their ringleaders kamarikan are those seven planets the head and tail of gochihr and mushpar provided with a tail which are ten and by them these ten worldly creations that is the sky water earth vegetation animals metals wind light fire and mankind are corrupted with all this vileness and from them calamity captivity disease death and other evils and corruptions ever come to water vegetation and the other creations which exist in the world owing to the fiendishness of those ten they whom i have enumerated are furnished with the assistance and crafty afzar-homand nature of ahriman regarding the cold dry stony and dark interior of mysterious tarik den afraj-pedak hell it says that the darkness is fit to grasp with the hand and the stench is fit to cut with a knife and if they inflict the punishment of a thousand men within a single span they the men think in this way that they are alone and the loneliness is worse than its punishment and its connection band is with the seven planets be it through much cold like saturn kevan be it through much heat like ahriman and their food is brimstone gandak and of succulents the lizard vazagh and other evil and wretchedness patyan on the spiritual chieftainship of the regions of the earth on the spiritual chieftainship of the regions of the earth it says in revelation that every one of those six chieftainships has one spiritual chief as the chief of arezahi is ashashagahad-e hvandchan the chief of sawahi is hoazarodathhri-hana pareshtyaro the chief of fradadhafshu is spitoid-i ausposinan the chief of vidadhafshu is airizh-rasp ausposinan the chief of wourubareshti is huvasp the chief of wourujareshti is cakhravak zartosht is spiritual chief of the region of xwaniratha and also of all the regions he is chief of the world of the righteous and it is said that the whole religion was received by them from zartosht in the region of xwaniratha are many places from which in this evil time of violent struggling with the adversary a passage vidarg is constructed by the power of the spiritual world mainokih and one calls them the beaten tracks of xwaniratha counterparts of those other regions are such places as kangdez the land of saukavastan the plain of the arabs tazhikan the plain of peshyansai the river naivtak eranvej the enclosure var formed by yim jamshed and cashmere in india and one immortal chief acts in the government of each of them as it says that peshotan son of vishtasp whom they call chitro-maino is in the country of kangdez aghrerad son of pashang is in the land of saukavastan and they call him gopatshah parshadga hvembya is in the plain of peshyansai and he is hvembya for this reason because they brought him up in a hvemb jar for fear of khashm wrath asam-i yamahusht is in the place which they call the river naivtak the tree opposed to harm is in eranvej urvatadnar son of zartosht is in the enclosure formed by yim jamshed regarding them it says they are those who are immortal as are narsih son of vivangha tus son of nodar giw son of gudarz ibairaz the causer of strife and ashavazd son of pourudhakhsht and they will all come forth to the assistance of soshyant on the production of the renovation of the universe regarding sam it says that he became immortal but owing to his disregard of the mazdayasnian religion a turk whom they call nihaj wounded him with an arrow when he was asleep there in the plain of peshyansai and it had brought upon him the unnatural lethargy bushasp which overcame him in the midst of the heat and the glory far of heaven stands over him for the purpose that when azi dahak zohak becomes unfettered arazhak he may arise and slay him and a myriad guardian spirits of the righteous are as a protection to him of dahak zohak whom they call bevarasp this too it says that faridoon when he captured dahak zohak was not able to kill him and afterwards confined him in mount damawand when he becomes unfettered sam arises and smites and slays him as to kangdez it is in the direction of the east at many leagues from the bed var of the wide-formed ocean towards that side the plain of peshyansai is in kavulistan as it says that the most remarkable upland balist in kavulistan is where peshyansai is there it is hotter on the more lofty elevations there is no heat eranvej is in the direction of ataro-patakan azerbaijan the land of saukavastan is on the way from turkistan to chinistan in the direction of the north the enclosure formed by yim jamshed is in the middle of pars in sruva thus they say that what yim jamshed formed yim-kard is below mount yimakan cashmere is in hindustan on the resurrection and future existence on the nature of the resurrection and future existence it says in revelation that whereas mashye and mashyane who grew up from the earth first fed upon water then plants then milk and then meat men also when their time of death has come first desist from eating meat then milk then from bread till when they shall die they always feed upon water so likewise in the millennium of ushedarmah the strength of appetite az will thus diminish when men will remain three days and nights in superabundance sirih through one taste of consecrated food then they will desist from meat food and eat vegetables and milk afterwards they abstain from milk food and abstain from vegetable food and are feeding on water and for ten years before soshyant comes they remain without food and do not die after soshyant comes they prepare the raising of the dead as it says that zartosht asked of ohrmazd thus whence does a body form again which the wind has carried and the water conveyed vazhid and how does the resurrection occur ohrmazd answered thus when through me the sky arose from the substance of the ruby without columns on the spiritual support of far-compassed light when through me the earth arose which bore the material life and there is no maintainer of the worldly creation but it when by me the sun and moon and stars are conducted in the firmament andarvai of luminous bodies when by me corn was created so that scattered about in the earth it grew again and returned with increase when by me color of various kinds was created in plants when by me fire was created in plants and other things without combustion when by me a son was created and fashioned in the womb of a mother and the structure pishak severally of the skin nails blood feet eyes ears and other things was produced when by me legs were created for the water so that it flows away and the cloud was created which carries the water of the world and rains there where it has a purpose when by me the air was created which conveys in ones eyesight through the strength of the wind the lowermost upwards according to its will and one is not able to grasp it with the hand out-stretched each one of them when created by me was herein more difficult than causing the resurrection for it is an assistance to me in the resurrection that they exist but when they were formed it was not forming the future out of the past observe that when that which was not was then produced why is it not possible to produce again that which was for at that time one will demand the bone from the spirit of earth the blood from the water the hair from the plants and the life from fire since they were delivered to them in the original creation first the bones of gayomard are roused up then those of mashye and mashyane then those of the rest of mankind in the fifty-seven years of soshyant they prepare all the dead and all men stand up whoever is righteous and whoever is wicked every human creature they rouse up from the spot where its life departs afterwards when all material living beings assume again their bodies and forms then they assign bara yehabund them a single class of the light accompanying levatman the sun one half will be for gayomard and one half will give enlightenment among the rest of men so that the soul and body will know that this is my father and this is my mother and this is my brother and this is my wife and these are some other of my nearest relations then is the assembly of the sadvastaran where all mankind will stand at this time in that assembly every one sees his own good deeds and his own evil deeds and then in that assembly a wicked man becomes as conspicuous as a white sheep among those which are black in that assembly whatever righteous man was friend of a wicked one in the world and the wicked man complains of him who is righteous thus why did he not make me acquainted when in the world with the good deeds which he practiced himself if he who is righteous did not inform him then it is necessary for him to suffer shame accordingly in that assembly afterwards they set the righteous man apart from the wicked and then the righteous is for heaven garothman and they cast the wicked back to hell three days and nights they inflict punishment bodily in hell and then he beholds bodily those three days happiness in heaven as it says that on the day when the righteous man is parted from the wicked the tears of every one thereupon run down unto his legs when after they set apart a father from his consort hambaz a brother from his brother and a friend from his friend they suffer every one for his own deeds and weep the righteous for the wicked and the wicked about himself for there may be a father who is righteous and a son wicked and there may be one brother who is righteous and one wicked those for whose peculiar deeds it is appointed such as dahak zohak and frasiyav of tur and others of this sort as those deserving death marg-arjanan undergo a punishment no other men undergo they call it the punishment of the three nights among his producers of the renovation of the universe those righteous men of whom it is written that they are living fifteen men and fifteen damsels will come to the assistance of soshyant as gochihr falls in the celestial sphere from a moon-beam on to the earth the distress of the earth becomes such-like as that of a sheep when a wolf falls upon it afterwards the fire and halo melt the metal of shahrewar in the hills and mountains and it remains on this earth like a river then all men will pass into that melted metal and will become pure when one is righteous then it seems to him just as though he walks continually in warm milk but when wicked then it seems to him in such manner as though in the world he walks continually in melted metal afterwards with the greatest affection all men come together father and son and brother and friend ask one another thus where has it been these many years and what was the judgment upon thy soul hast thou been righteous or wicked the first soul the body sees it inquires of it with those words guft all men become of one voice and administer loud praise to ohrmazd and the archangels ohrmazd completes his work at that time and the creatures become so that it is not necessary to make any effort about them and among those by whom the dead are prepared it is not necessary that any effort be made soshyant with his assistants performs a yazishn ceremony in preparing the dead and they slaughter the ox hadhayosh in that yazishn from the fat of that ox and the white haoma they prepare hush and give it to all men and all men become immortal for ever and everlasting this too it says that whoever has been the size of a man they restore him then with an age of forty years they who have been little when not dead they restore then with an age of fifteen years and they give every one his wife and show him his children with the wife so they act as now in the world but there is no begetting of children afterwards soshyant and his assistants by order of the creator ohrmazd give every man the reward and recompense suitable to his deeds this is even the righteous existence ait where it is said that they convey him to paradise wahisht and the heaven garothman of ohrmazd takes up the body kerp as itself requires with that assistance he continually advances for ever and everlasting this too it says that whoever has performed no worship yasht and has ordered no getig-kharid and has bestowed no clothes as a righteous gift is naked there and he performs the worship yasht of ohrmazd and the heavenly angels provide him the use of his clothing afterwards ohrmazd seizes on the evil spirit vohuman on akoman ardwahisht on andar shahrewar on savar spandarmad on taromat who is naunghas hordad and amurdad on tairev and zairich true-speaking on what is evil-speaking srosh on eshm then two fiends remain at large ahriman and az ohrmazd comes to the world himself the zota and srosh the raspi and holds the kusti in his hand defeated by the kusti formula the resources of the evil spirit and az act most impotently and by the passage through which he rushed into the sky he runs back to gloom and darkness gochihr burns the serpent mar in the melted metal and the stench and pollution which were in hell are burned in that metal and it hell becomes quite pure he ohrmazd sets the vault into which the evil spirit fled in that metal he brings the land of hell back for the enlargement of the world the renovation arises in the universe by his will and the world is immortal for ever and everlasting this too it says that this earth becomes an iceless slopeless plain even the mountain whose summit is the support of the chinwad bridge they keep down and it will not exist on the race and offspring of the kayans on the race and genealogy of the kayanians hooshang was son of fravak son of siyamak son of mashye son of gayomard tahmurasp was son of vivangha son of yanghad son of hooshang yim jamshed tahmurasp spitur and narsih whom they also call the rashnu of chino were all brothers from yim jamshed and yimak who was his sister was born a pair man and woman and they became husband and wife together mirak the aspiyan and ziyanak zardahim were their names and the lineage went on spitur was he who with dahak zohak cut up yim jamshed narsih lived then also whom they call nesr-gyavan they say that such destiny gadman is allotted to him that he shall pass every day in troubles and shall make all food purified and pure dahak zohak was son of khrutasp son of zainigav son of virafsang son of tazh son of fravak son of siyamak by his mother dahak zohak was of udai son of bayak

bortora the aspiyan son of siyak-tora- the aspiyan son of sped-tora the aspiyan son of gefar-tora the aspiyan son of ramak-tora the aspiyan son of vanfragheshn the aspiyan son of yim jamshed son of vivangha as these apart from the aspiyan purtora were ten generations they every one lived a hundred years which becomes one-thousand years those thousand years were the evil reign of dahak zohak by the aspiyan pur-tora was begotten faridoon who exacted vengeance for yim jamshed together with him also were the sons barmayun and katayun but faridoon was fuller of glory than they by faridoon three sons were begotten salm and tuj and airik and by airik one son and one pair were begotten the names of the couple of sons were vanidar and anastokh and the name of the daughter was guzhak salm and tuj slew them all airik and his happy sons but faridoon kept the daughter in concealment and from that daughter a daughter was born they became aware of it and the mother was slain by them faridoon provided for the daughter also in concealment for ten generations when manush-i khurshed-vinik was born from his mother so called because as he was born some of the light of the sun khwarshed fell upon his nose vinik from manush-i khurshed-vinik and his sister was manush-khurnar and from manush-khurnar and his sister was manuschihar born by whom salm and tuj were slain in revenge for airik by

guzak of airik of faridoon so frasiyav was of pashang of zaeshm of turak of spaenyasp of duroshasp of tuj of faridoon he frasiyav as well as karsevaz whom they call kadan and aghrerad were all three brothers pashang and visak were both brothers by visak were piran human shan and other brothers begotten by frasiyav were frasp-i chur shan shedak and other sons begotten and vispan-frya from whom kay

mountain-range gar of padashkh-var and scattered ruin and want among them aghrerad begged a favor of god yazdan and he obtained the benefit that the army and champions of the iranians were saved by him from that distress frasiyav slew aghrerad for that fault and aghrerad as his recompense begat such a son as gopatshah auzobo the tuhmaspian kanak-i barzisht arawishanasp and vaetand-i raghinoid were the three sons and the daughter of agaimasvak the son of nodar son of manuschihar who begat auzobo kavad was a child in a waist-cloth kuspud they abandoned him on a river and he froze upon the

urvad-gai-frasht son of rak son of durasrobo son of manuschihar this too it says that the glory of faridoon settled on the root of a reed kanya in the wide-formed ocean and noktarga through sorcery formed a cow for tillage and begat children there three years he carried the reeds there and gave them to the cow until the glory went on to the cow he brought the cow milked her milk and gave it to his three sons as their walking was on hoofs the glory did not go to the sons but to farhank noktarga wished to injure farhank but farhank went with the glory away from the fierce tib father and made a vow patyastak thus i will give my first son to aushbam then aushbam saved her from the father and the first son kay apiveh she bore and gave to aushbam was a hero associating with aushbam and traveled in aushbams company the mother of auzobo was the daughter of namun the wizard when namak was with frasiyav and moreover together with those begotten by sam were six children in pairs male and female the name of one was damnak of one khosraw and of one margandak and the name of each man and woman together was one and the name of one besides them was dastan he was considered more eminent than they and sagansih and the southern quarter were given to him and avar-shatro and the governorship were given by him to avarnak of avar-shatro this is said that it is the district of avarnak and they offered blessings to srosh and ardwahisht in succession on this account is their possession of horses and possession of arms and on account of firm religion purity and manifest joy good

bring were among them to sparnak the governorship of spahan was given to khosraw the governorship of rai was given to margandak the kingdom forest settlements and mountain settlements of

religion and by arasti was maidyok-mah begotten zartosht when he brought the religion first celebrated worship and expounded in eranvej and maidyok-mah received the religion from him the mobads of pars are all traced back to this race of manuschihar again i say by zartosht were begotten three sons and three daughters one son was isadvastar one aurvatad-nar and one khurshed-chihar as isadvastar was chief of the priests he became the mobed of mobads and passed away in the hundredth year of the religion aurvatad-nar was an agriculturist and the chief of the enclosure formed by yim jamshed which is below the earth khurshed-chihar was a warrior commander of the army of peshotan son of vishtasp and dwells in kangdez and of the three daughters the name of one was fren of one srit and of

him aranj-i biradan fore-arm of brothers for this reason that as they were from a serving wife she then delivered them over to isadvastar through adoption this too one knows that three sons of zartosht namely ushedar ushedarmah and soshyant were from hvov as it says that zartosht went near unto hvov three times and each time the seed went to the ground the angel neryosang received the brilliance and strength of that seed delivered it with care to the angel anahid and in time will blend it with a mother nine-thousand-nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine and nine myriads of the guardian spirits of the righteous are entrusted with its protection so that the demons may not injure it the name of the mother of zartosht was dogdo and the name of the father of the mother of zartosht was

hamid ashovahisht son of freh-srosh and the other mobads have sprung from the same family this too it says that in one winter i will locate jakinam the religion of the mazdayasnians which came out into the other six regions on the reckoning of the years time was for twelve thousand years and it says in revelation that three-thousand years was the duration of the spiritual state where the creatures were unthinking unmoving and intangible and three-thousand years was the duration of gayomard with the ox in the world as this was six thousand years the series of millennium reigns of
