nyame, the high god, created the world including the trickster spider, ananse. but it was ananse who made the first people, into whom the sky-god nyame (nyankopon) then breathed life. ananse enjoyed working behind the high godÃªs back, disguising himself as a bird and even challenging him as a creator, creat- ing the sun, moon, and stars as well as night and day.
