an ancient vietnamese creation myth abounds with animist symbolism. lac long quan, the son of a mountain god and a water dragon, was given the land of lac viet by his parents. he built two palaces, one in the mountains and one in the ocean. later he fell in love with a beautiful fairy, au co, and transformed himself into a handsome young man to win her over. they married, and a year later, she laid a hundred eggs that hatched into human babies that quickly matured into adults. unfortunately, lac long quan remained in his water palace while au co lived on land. she became lonely and pined for her homeland, so much so that she took her hundred children to visit it. it became obvious that the couple should separate. they agreed that half the children would go with their father to the land next to the ocean, and the others would follow their mother to the mountains, thus creating the vietnamese race – the dragon and the fairy’s grandchildren.
