the creator looked down from the heavens and liked the island of the yami, and he dropped a stone on the place that would become ipaptok village (a paptok is a bean plant from which the first people got food). when the stone hit the ground, a man came out, and he ate of the plant. as he walked about later, he saw a piece of bamboo growing on the shore. it divided, and a man stepped out. one of the men asked the other, „who are we?‰ and the other said, „we are man.‰ bamboo son walked one way, and found silver, while stone son found iron. the two sons came home and worked on the iron and silver·one hard, one soft. one day a boy child burst from the swollen right knee of bamboo son and a girl sprang from his left knee. the same thing happened to stone son. the children grew, and in time they married properly: bamboo with stone, stone with bamboo. everyone was happy. then the people made canoes. bamboo sonês silver axe was too soft to fell trees, so the people made beautiful helmets out of the silver and kept the iron for axes. the canoes were beautifully designed, but bambooês son put the support ribs on the inside of his canoe and it broke up at sea. stone sonês ribs were on the outside, and his canoe survived, but it leaked. he fixed the leak with the fiber of the kulau tree, which the people still use today to make plugs for stopping leaks. in their silver helmets and outer-ribbed canoes, the people celebrate the sacred fish-calling at the flying fish festival by the singing of ipaptok, where man first burst out of the dark nothingness.
