 in the beginning there was nothing - no earth, no living beings. there were only darkness, water, and cyclone, the wind. there were no humans, but only the hactcin, the jicarilla supernatural beings. the hactcin made the earth, the underworld beneath it, and the sky above it. the earth they made as a woman who faces upward, and the sky they made as a man who faces downward. the hactcin lived in the underworld, where there was no light. there were mountains and plants in the underworld, and each had its own hactcin. there were as yet no animals or humans, and everything in the underworld existed in a dream-like state and was spiritual and holy. the most powerful of the hactcin in the underworld was black hactcin. one day black hactcin made the first animal with four legs and a tail made of clay. at first he thought it looked peculiar, but when he asked it to walk and saw how gracefully it walked, he decided it was good. knowing this animal would be lonely, he made many other kinds of animals come from the body of the first. he laughed to see the diversity of the animals he had created. all the animals wanted to know what to eat and where to live, so he divided the foods among them, giving grass to the horse, sheep, and cow, and to others he gave brush, leaves, and pine needles. he sent them out to different places, some to the mountains, some to the deserts, and some to the plains, which is why the animals are found in different places today. next black hactcin held out his hand and caught a drop of rain. he mixed this with some earth to make mud and made a bird from the mud. at first he wasn't sure he would like what he had made. he asked the bird to fly, and when it did he liked it. he decided the bird too would be lonely, so he grabbed it and whirled it rapidly clockwise. as the bird became dizzy, it saw images of other birds, and when black hactcin stopped whirling it, there were indeed many new kinds of birds, all of which live in the air because they were made from a drop of water that came from the air. black hactcin sent the birds out to find places they liked to live, and when they returned he gave each the place that they liked. to feed them, he threw seeds all over the ground. to tease them, however, he turned the seeds into insects, and he watched as they chased after the insects. at a river nearby, he told the birds to drink. again, however, he couldn't resist teasing them, so he took some moss and made fish, frogs, and the other things that live in water. this frightened the birds as they came to drink, and it is why birds so often hop back in fright as they come down to drink. as some of the birds took off, their feathers fell in the water, and from them came the ducks and other birds that live in the water. black hactcin continued to make more animals and birds. the animals and birds that already existed all spoke the same language, and they held a council. they came to black hactcin and asked for a companion. they were concerned that they would be alone when black hactcin left them, and black hactcin agreed to make something to keep them company. he stood facing the east, and then the south, and then the west, and then the north. he had the animals bring him all sorts of materials from across the land, and he traced his outline on the ground. he then set the things that they brought him in the outline. the turquoise that they brought became veins, the red ochre became blood, the coral became skin, the white rock became bones, the mexican opal became fingernails and teeth, the jet became the pupil, the abalone became the white of the eyes, and the white clay became the marrow of the bones. pollen, iron ore, and water scum were used too, and black hactcin used a dark cloud to make the hair. the man they had made was lying face down, and it began to rise as the birds watched with excitement. the man arose from prone, to kneeling, to sitting up, and to standing. four times black hactcin told him to speak, and he did. four times black hactcin told him to laugh, and he did. it was likewise with shouting. then black hactcin taught him to walk, and had him run four times in a clockwise circle. the birds and animals were afraid the man would be lonely, and they asked black hactcin give him company. black hactcin asked them for some lice, which he put on the man's head. the man went to sleep scratching, and he dreamed that there was a woman beside him. when he awoke, she was there. they asked black hactcin what they would eat, and he told them that the plants and the cloven-hoofed animals would be their food. they asked where they should live. he told them to stay anywhere they liked, which is why the jicarilla move from place to place. these two, ancestral man and ancestral woman, had children, and the people multiplied. in those days no one died, although they all lived in darkness. this lasted for many years. the hactcins made a sun and moon, but they could only be seen through a hole in the dark sky. to solve the problem, white hactcin turned to the animals and had them bring the foods they ate. with the food and some sand and water, they began to grow a mountain. the mountain grew, but it stopped short of the hole in the sky that led from the underworld to the earth that we know. the hactcins sent up fly and spider, who took four rays of the sun and built a rope ladder to the upper world. the hactcins called for the people to climb up, and for four days they climbed the mountain. at the top they found four ladders. ancestral man and ancestral woman were the first people to climb up, and the people climbed up into the upper world that we know today. thus the earth is our mother, and the people climbed up as from a womb. then the animals came up, and before long the ladders were worn out. behind the animals came an old man and an old woman, and they couldn't climb the ladders. no one could get them up, and finally the two realized they had to stay in the underworld. they agreed to stay but told the others they must come back to the underworld eventually, which is why people go to the underworld after death. everything in the upper world is alive - the rocks, the trees, the grass, the plants, the fire, the water. originally they all spoke the jicarilla apache language and spoke to the people. eventually the people travelled out clockwise across the land. different groups would break off and stay behind, and their children would begin to play games in which they used odd languages. the people in these groups began to forget their old languages and use these new ones, which is why now there are many languages. only one group kept on traveling in the clockwise spiral until they reached the center of the world, and these are the jicarilla apaches.
