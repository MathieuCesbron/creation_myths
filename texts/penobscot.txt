in the beginning the creator, the allmaker, created a helper from a wave in the primeval waters. helper-to-all-maker helped the all-maker create the world· the plants, the animals, the mountains, the rivers, the forests. then one day, as they were working, some dew fell on the leaf of a magical plant and, warmed by the sun, the plant produced a beautiful young woman, who was first mother. first mother mated with helper-to-all-maker and the first people were born. the people were guided in their lives by first mother, but soon there were too many people and the food ran out and first mother became terribly sad. there was only one hope, she told her husband. you must kill me and then do as i say. her husband refused and went to the all-maker for advice. „you must do as she says,‰ said the creator. so helper-to-all-maker returned to his wife and agreed to do as she said. first mother instructed him in detail, telling him to kill her when the sun was highest in the sky and then have her sons drag her over the empty parts of the earth by her long silky hair, thus scraping the flesh from her body. then they were to go away and come back after seven moons. when they came back they would find the food of her flesh. returning in seven moons, the people found that the flesh of first mother had come to life as beautiful tall plants with silken hair and wonderful fruit·the delicious and nutritious fruit of the flesh of first mother, now known as corn mother. following the motherês earlier instructions, they saved some of the kernels of the fruit and planted them each year, and so corn mother returned to them each year as a result.
