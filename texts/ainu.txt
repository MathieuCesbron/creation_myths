in the beginning there was a mixture of mud and water in what would become the world; no living things existed. the gods and demons and animals lived in a series of heavens above and worlds below our world. in the highest heaven there was the creator god kamui. his compound was protected by an immense wall with an iron gate. kamui decided to build the world on the back of a huge fish that took in the waters and blew them out to create the ocean tides. the creator sent a small bird, a wagtail, to make earth habitable. confused, the bird flew down and fluttered about and beat its wings at the mushy surface until a few dry spots emerged, forming the islands where the ainu live now.
