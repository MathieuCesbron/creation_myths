in the beginning there were two gods, obassi osaw and obassi nsi, who created everything together until obassi osaw decided to live in the sky and obassi nsi decided to live on the earth. obassi osaw gives light and moisture, but he also brings the pain of draught and storms. obassi nsi, however, is a nurturer, and he takes us back into himself when we dies. one day long ago, the sky god made a man and a woman and placed them on the earth. they knew nothing about food or drink, so obassi nsi taught them about planting and obassi osaw sent down water from his great blue cloak. the people learned to grow and eat the fruit of the palm tree and to use it for medicine as well. the gods have treated the people well.
