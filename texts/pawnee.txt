in the beginning was space itself, tirawahat (tirawa). it was he who organized the gods in creation. he placed sun in the east and moon in the west. evening star was to be the mother and was placed in the west. morning star was the brave in the east who would chase the star people into the west. then tirawahat made four other stars into the supporters of the four corners of the world. he gave the wind, the thunder, the lightning, and the clouds to evening star, and they sang, rattled, and danced as tirawahat created the earth. he dropped a pebble into the clouds and there was water. the earth-supporters struck the water with their clubs and earth was formed. to populate the earth, evening star took morning star as her husband, and they produced mother of humanity. sun and moon produced father of humanity. evening star then made the sacred bundle, and the elements·clouds, wind, thunder, and lightning·taught the new people the sacred songs and dances they still perform, calling it the thunder ceremony. some say the elements became paruhti, who crosses over the barren winter earth and brings the new life of spring. still others, who mistrust the power of women, say evening star, or west star woman, had to be overpowered by morning star, the great star, before creation could be accomplished. followed by his brother, who carried the sacred bundle, morning star headed west toward evening star, who moved along luring morning star toward her. when morning star got close to her, however, evening star placed things in his way to hinder and tease him. for instance, once she beckoned to him, and as he approached she caused the earth to open and all the waters of the heavens to fall down into the mouth of the great serpent. morning star won out by throwing a ball of fire into the serpentês mouth. when he got to the lodge of evening star, he had to overcome the stars of the four directions. then he had his way with evening star.
