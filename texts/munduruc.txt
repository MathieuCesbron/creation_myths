one day karusakaibo was so angry at daiiru that the little armadillo hid in the ground. the creator blew into the hole and stomped his foot so hard that the culprit was blasted out. he told karusakaibo that there were humans below the earth. the two friends, now reconciled, decided to get the humans up to the surface. they made a beautiful rope of cotton, such as the mundurucs make today, and dropped it down the hole with daiiru tied to one end. he showed the people how to climb out, but so many hung onto the rope that it broke. half of the people had to stay in the underworld, where they still are. everything is the opposite there from what it is here; the sun goes in the opposite direction, it is night there when it is day here, and the moon is there when it is not here. the people came up at necodemos, and the mundurucs are the ones who look most like karusakaibo.
