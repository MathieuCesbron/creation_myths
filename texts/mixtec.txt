the earth was covered in water and darkness, and green slime was on the waters. time began when the mixtec deer god, puma-snake, and his beautiful stag goddess wife, jaguar-snake, took human form and tamed the chaos, making a wondrous home for themselves on top of a cliff they raised over the waters. they rested the sky on a great ax they had placed on the cliff. these first gods had two sons, windnine snake and wind-nine cave, who played on the great cliff and had marvelous powers. they learned the arts of husbandry, and they used tobacco to pray to the gods for an earth on which people could plant things. the creator god agreed to their wish and freed the earth of the primeval sea so people could plant and roam about. the cliff home of the gods is still in oaxaca near the mixtec river of origins where the first mixtec were born from the trees. some say that after the deer deities had more children, a great flood destroyed much of the world, but the creator remade heaven and earth.
