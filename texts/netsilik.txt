some say that early people came out of the ground from tussocks (clumps of grass) and that mysterious women who already existed here nursed the new people. others say they donêt know about the beginning·only that the earth and people are here now. they say that long ago the only thing there was the sea·no animals. the people, when they first lived on earth, did not use fat to burn in their lamps. in those days new snow would burn, so animal fat wasnêt necessary. in these first days the people had to travel long distances to find food. they say, however, that the first people had magic words that when spoken could carry them·house and all·to a new place where they could become part of a new settlement and find food. but it was dark in those days and forests existed but only at the bottom of the sea. also, there wasnêt any ice on the sea in those days. and there were only men·no women. they say that men made women. this is how: there was a great rain flood that destroyed everything. the animals died and so did the people·all but two men, who lived together as if they were married, and one of them became pregnant. since they were also shamans they were able to change the pregnant manês penis into a vagina so he/she could give birth. this is how the people began again.
