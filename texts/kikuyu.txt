the supreme deity, ngai, created the world and made mount kenya, from which he could observe his creation. he created the father of the kikuyu, gikuyu, and sent him to a beautiful place full of wild fig trees. he explained to gikuyu that if he ever needed his help he should perform certain animal sacrifices. then he went away. when gikuyu arrived at the beautiful land he discovered there a beautiful woman, mumbi („one who creates‰), and he married her. soon they had nine daughters (some say 10). gikuyu asked ngai for sons to marry his daughters. the god told gikuyu to sacrifice a lamb and a kid and pour out their blood on a special fig tree. nine fine men came out of the ground. some say that the nine women brought sticks that matched their heights, that these sticks were used for a sacrificial fire and that the nine men emerged from the fire. the nine men married the nine women and formed the nine kikuyu clans.
