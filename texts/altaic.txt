in the beginning there was nothing in the world but the primordial waters. one day two black geese flew back and forth over the waters. one of the geese was actually the creator. the other would become the first human, but he was also the devil, and he could not resist trying to fly higher than the god. furious, the god made the man-devil fall into the waters. when the man-devil begged for help, god made him dive down under the waters for a rock and then earth, which god turned into the world. when god asked the man-devil to bring him more earth, the man-devil did so, but he hid some in his mouth, thinking he would create his own world when the creator was not looking. both the earth that he handed the god and the earth in his mouth began immediately to grow. pained by the enormous swell- ing of his mouth, the man-devil begged once again for the lordês help, and the god chastised him before allowing him to spit out the material in his mouth. this earth was soggy material that became the earthês wetlands.
