the creator did his work from the east to the west, giving a different language to each group of people he made. when he got to puget sound he liked it so much he decided to stop there. this is why there are so many different languages in puget sound and nearby. the people complained about the low sky on which they constantly bumped their heads. the elders of the tribes met in council and decided to push the sky up. at an appointed time, someone would shout, „ya-hoh,‰ meaning lift together in all of the puget sound languages, and the people would all press upwards with huge fur trees. it was difficult, but the people did use this method to push up the sky to where it is now. there were three hunters, however, who knew nothing about the sky raising. they were chasing four elks over where the earth meets the sky, and they followed the elks into the sky when they leaped there. when the sky went up, so did the elks and hunters. they are still there now. the hunters are the handle of the big dipper, while the four elks are the bowl. a little star nearby is the dog of one of the hunters. others were caught in the sky that day·a little fish and six men in two canoes·and they are stars now too. the puget sound people still say „ya-hoh‰ when they want to lift something together.
