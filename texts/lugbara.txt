the people are all of one blood. the creator, adronga âba oêbapiri, made this blood ex nihilo for the first two creatures he placed here. these were gborogboro (sky person·male) and meme (big body-female). meme was full of wild animals, who sprang from her womb. gborogboro and meme, a form of heaven and earth, were married. after meme gave birth to the animals, the creator placed children in her womb, or, as some say, the pair coupled and children were conceived·a boy and a girl. this boy and girl made another male and female pair, and that pair did the same. it is said by some that the various brother-sister pairs never copulated but that the women became pregnant when goatês blood was poured onto their legs. people also say that eventually humans and the creator were separated and that the people, although carrying the same blood, were separated into black and white.
