unkulunkulu, the ancient one, is the zulu creator. nobody knows where he is now; he came originally·that is, he broke off·from some reeds, which play the role more usually played by a cosmic egg. some say that he was the reeds, because the word for them, uthlanga, also means „source.‰ it was he who broke off the people from the reeds and then the cattle and other peoples. he also broke off medicine men and dreams. he was really the first man and the progenitor of other men. unkulunkulu created everything that is·mountains, cattle, streams, snakes. he taught the zulu how to hunt, how to make fire with sticks, and how to eat corn. he named the animals for them. the people say that unkulunkulu is in everything; unkulunkulu is the corn, the tree, the water. some say that a woman followed him out of the original reeds, then a cow and a bull, then the other pairs of animals. whatever the story, unkulunkulu was the first man and there was nothing before him; yet he broke off from the source.
