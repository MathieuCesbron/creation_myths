it is god who hath given you the earth as a sure foundation, and over it built up the heaven, and formed you, and made your forms beautiful, and feedeth you with good things. this is god your lord. blessed then be god the lord of the worlds! he is the living one. no god is there but he. call then upon him and offer him pure worship. praise be the god the lord of the worlds! say: verily i am forbidden to worship what ye call on beside god, after that the clear tokens have come to me from my lord, and i am bidden to surrender myself to the lord of the worlds. he it is who created you of the dust, then of the germs of life, then of thick blood, then brought you forth infants: then he letteth you reach your full strength, and then become old men (but some of you die first), and reach the ordained term. and this that ye may haply understand.
