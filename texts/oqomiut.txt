once there was anguta, who lived with his daughter, the beautiful and much-desired sedna. when a great seabird, a fulmar, flew over her one spring day and urged her to follow him over the sea to his home, sedna went. when she got there, however, she was horrified by the fulmarês foul tent and lack of food. she called in despair for her father, and after a year had passed, he came with the warm winds that broke up the ice. he killed the fulmar and put his daughter in his boat for the journey home. when the other fulmars found the body of their chief they mourned·as they still do today with their sad cries· and they became angry. they searched the sea for the murderer and blew up a huge storm when they saw the boat of sednaês father. to save himself, the father threw his daughter overboard and chopped her fingers when she tried to hold onto the boat. parts of the fingers fell into the water and became whales; other parts became other fish and sea creatures. finally sedna fell into the sea and the storm subsided. sedna was not dead, however, and she climbed back into the boat. sedna did not love her father any longer, and when he was asleep, she ordered her dogs to bite off his hands and feet. this they did before he woke up. in fury, anguta cursed everything and everyone, and the earth swallowed him, the dogs, and sedna. just before going down, sedna created the deer. sedna, anguta, and the dogs now live under the world in adlivun. sedna rules there, and anguta hobbles around there with no feet. when people die, they go to sednaês house in adlivun. the bad ones have to sleep next to anguta, who pinches them.
