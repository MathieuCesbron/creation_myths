god (arebate) created the world and the first man whom he made from clay with the moon’s help. after kneading the man’s body, arebati covered the clay with a skin and then poured blood into it to bring the first human to life. god called the first human baatsi. in the beginning there was no death, when people grew old he made them young again. then god whispered into his ear telling him to beget many children, but to impress upon the children the following rule: from all trees you may eat, but not from the tahu tree. baatsi had many children and he made them obey the rule. when he became old he retired to heaven. his children obeyed the rule and when they grew old they too retired to heaven. but one day a pregnant woman craved the tahu fruit and asked her husband get some for her, but he refused. but when she persisted, the husband gave in. he crept into the forest at night, picked the tahu fruit, peeled it, and hid the peel in the bush. the moon saw this and told the creator. the creator was so angry with humans because of this that he sent death as a punishment to men.
