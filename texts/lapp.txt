the saami creation myth, directly related to their harsh environment, tells the story of a monstrous giant named biegolmai, the wind man. in the beginning of time, biegolmai created the sapmi region by taking two huge shovels, one to whip up the wind and the other to drop such huge amounts of snow that no one could live there. one day, however, one of biegolmaiâ€™s shovels broke, the wind died down, and the saami were able to enter sapmi.
