when the world was still dark, there was a chief whose son got sick and died. the parents mourned their son and made everyone else do so as well. one morning the mother went to look at her sonês body and was surprised to find a dazzling young man there. he had been sent by the sun, he said, to stop the wailing of the parents and their people. the parents thought this was their son returned. the young man, despite the urging of the mother, would not eat. then he met two slaves, one male and one female, called mouth at both ends. after meeting them and being affected by their power, he ate everything there was to eat in the settlement. the chief gave him a ravenês mask and renamed him giant. the chief also gave raven-giant a bladder full of seeds and suggested that he fly to the mainland and plant them for food. he also gave him a stone to rest on in case he got tired. raven-giant stole daylight so the world could be light and so his plants would grow. he did this by flying up to heaven and hiding in the drinking bucket of the big chiefês daughter there. when she drank, she swallowed him and became pregnant. then he was born in the sky chiefês house and was able to steal some light. raven-giant brought all sorts of things to humans·including death.
