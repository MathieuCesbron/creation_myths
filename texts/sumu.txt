after they made the beautiful world that we call nature, the creator brothers struck out in a canoe to admire their work and decide what they should do next. the rapids caught them, however; and they were thrown into the water. after swimming to shore, they made a fire to get warm and found some maize nearby to roast. when they threw the cobs onto the ground, animals sprang up and scampered away. papan threw some of the cobs into the water and they be- came fish. some he threw into the air and they became birds. eventually there were animals everywhere and the broth- ers were well pleased. papan was so happy and entranced by a bird that, as he watched it, he stepped back into the fire and was consumed by the flames. he rose up into the air and became the sun. as the younger brother watched he also fell into the fire, but he struggled to stay on the earth; the sparks he made became the stars. eventually he was consumed, however; and he became the moon.
