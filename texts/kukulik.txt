raven first made the unisak cape shoreline, then the russian part of the world, then the american. he rested for a bit and then, in earth-diver fashion, reached down into the deep water for some sand. he squeezed the water out of the sand and made the village of cibukak (wrung out) from it. out of the pebbles in the sand he made the people, and he told them how to pick seaweed and hunt sea animals and fish. one day a man decided to travel to the sun to ask him for reindeer for the people. sun refused, but he did give the man certain pebbles, which he said should be thrown into the water. the man did as he was told, and when the stones hit the water they became whales. the kukulik eskimos are still whalers.
