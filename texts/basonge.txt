the great creator god, fidi mkullu, was challenged by his son nkolle (before he became arrogant his name had been mwile), who claimed to have created ev- erything. fidi mkullu said, „if you are so good at creating, go down to earth and rule the human race creatively.‰ so nkolle descended to earth and became a chief. but no matter what he did nkolle could not solve human illness, human pain, or the problem of death. so nkolle left to return to heaven and the people begged fidi mkullu to be their chief. he agreed and did much to alleviate human suffering, proving himself to be the true creator.
