in the beginning, the only thing that existed was dievas, the primordial god. when the earth was made, he created mara, the goddess of earth and motherhood. she would decompose the body of a dead organism, with dievas taking its soul to the afterlife. some time after the world was made, dievas accidentally created humanity out of his saliva, which landed on the rich soil. however, he wasn't concerned about this new creation and let them develop by themselves. after this, dievas created the blacksmith god, teliavelis. he created saule, the sun goddess, and a husband for her, menuo, the moon god. the pair then ruled the sky, bringing light to the universe and creating thousands of stars as their childhood. sadly, this did not last, as menuo cheated on her with ausrine, the morning star and goddess of dawn. out of fury, saule cut him up, and he would be re-assembled and disassembled every month, bringing on the phases of the moon. the gods then chose their leader, perkunas, the god of lightning and thunder. he rode in a chariot pulled by flying goats, bringing lightning wherever he went. every day, perkunas would chase dievas's evil, one eyed brother, velinas. velinas would often use his wit and transformation skills to avoid him.
