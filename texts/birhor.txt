the creator, singbonga, arises out of the primordial waters through the stem of a lotus. he sits on the lotus and from that position sends a series of animals into the depths of the waters to find the mud with which he plans to create the world. after many animals fail in this task, the leech succeeds by swallowing some of the mud and spitting it into the creatorÃªs hand when he emerges exhausted from the waters. it was this tiny bit of mud that singbonga used to create the world and its humans.
