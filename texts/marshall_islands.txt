in ancient times when there was only water, lowa, the uncreated, was alone. when he made a humming sound the islands emerged, along with the reefs and sandbanks. he hummed again and the plants and animals arrived. lowa made four gods for the four directions and a gull god to constantly circle the sky. lowa also created a man, who put the islands into a basket made from coconut leaves and tried to set them in orderÂ·the carolines to the west and the marshalls in a straight line, except for namorik, which fell out of the basket. after he had placed all the islands, he threw away the basket, and it became kili island. only one of the islands had coconut trees at the time. this was the little sandy island of bikini (from bok, meaning sand, and ni, meaning coconut). lowa sent his tattooists down to the islands to give each creature its own mark.
