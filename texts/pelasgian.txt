in the beginning, eurynome, the goddess of all things, rose naked from chaos. she found nothing upon which to rest her feet, and thus, she divided the sea from the sky. she danced lonely upon the waves of the sea. she danced towards the south, and the wind set in motion behind her seemed something new and strange with which to begin a work of creation. wheeling about, she caught hold of this north wind, rubbed it between her hands, and behold! the great serpent ophion. eurynome danced to warm herself, wildly and more wildly, until ophion, enchanted, coiled about her divine limbs becoming one with her. as she lay with the ophion, eurynome was got with child. eurynome assumed the form of a dove, brooding upon the waves and with time, she laid the universal egg. at her bidding, ophion coiled seven times about this egg, until it hatched and split into two. out tumbled all things that exist, her children: sun, moon, planets, stars, earth with her mountains rivers, trees, herbs, and all living creatures. eurynome and ophion made their home upon mount olympus where he vexed her by claiming to be the author of the universe. forthwith, she bruised his head with her heel, kicked out his teeth, and banished him to the dark caves below the earth. eurynome opened her gaze and her arms to her children, giving each its name which she read off its own singular power and being. she named the sun, moon, planets, stars and the earth with her mountains and rivers, trees, herbs and living creatures. she took joy in her creation, but soon found herself alone desiring the face, voice, ear and warmth of another of her own. eurynome stood up and once again began to dance alone upon the waves.
