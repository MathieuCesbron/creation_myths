in time our world will come to an end, but also in time the world will evolve again. then everything will be covered in water and darkness. for a long time there will be no sun, moon, stars, or sea- sons, and there will be no creatures, no humans. after a still longer time, earth will form on the waters, as skin forms on cooling hot milk. then some greedy being from a former birth will forsake the heavenly radiance of the buddha soul-life for the life of the body and will take pleasure in the earthÃªs sweet- ness. then others will follow, and they will gradually become more body than radiant buddha soul. as their light fades, the sun, moon, and stars will appear. gradually humans will develop sexual characteristics, which will be followed by passion and then by selfishness and other evils. in time the new world will come to its end.
