in the beginning there were only the waters until god sent down fire. the fire burnt part of the ocean, and land came. as soon as god set foot on the new land he found buninka, the devil, there. buninka wanted to create his own world, and he got so angry when god refused to let him do so that he broke godês lyre. god challenged buninka to make a tree out of the water to prove his powers. buninka agreed, but the pine tree he cre- ated was weak and it leaned over. god cre- ated a tree that was strong and constantly growing. buninka therefore recognized godês power over him and all things.
