in the beginning the creator made a perfect world of trees, mountains, rivers, lakes, and plants. but when he looked around, happy with his world, he knew there was something missing. there was plenty of beauty but nothing to enjoy it. so it was that the creator decided to make the animals·animals of all kinds·who also enjoyed the new earth. things went well with the animals and their earth, but after a while the animals complained of a lack of purpose in their lives. the creator thought about this and then agreed to make a change. he would give the animals a weaker being that they would protect and teach. this new cre- ation would be weak and ignorant. the new creature was humankind·a man and a woman·and the animals were de- lighted to help them out, teaching them how to survive. but soon trouble began. the first hu- mans made more humans and the new human population became stronger and more demanding of the animals. one day, when a man demanded more food of an animal than he needed, the ani- mal refused and the man crushed the animalês skull with a rock. he then used the animalês flesh as meat and its skin as clothes. when he told the other humans about this the humans began the process of killing animals for their own use. angry at what he saw, the creator called a meeting of humans and animals and announced that he would take all the animals to the spirit world as a punish- ment of the humans. it was only because the animals took pity on the foolish hu- mans that the creator relented and left the animals on earth. but to protect them he took away the ability of humans and animals to talk with each other and he made the animals fear humans so that they would naturally be more difficult for humans to kill. the creator also instituted the totem tradition, creating spirit animals to rep- resent human groups for guidance and protection.
