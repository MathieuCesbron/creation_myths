in the beginning raven, the self-cre- ated, lived with his wife in a tiny space. bored with her existence, the wife asked raven to create the earth. „but i canêt,‰ he said. „well, then,‰ said the wife, „i shall create at least something.‰ she lay down to sleep, with raven watching over her. as she slept, the wife seemed to lose her feathers and then to grow very fat, and then without even waking up she released twins from her body. like the mother, they had no feathers. raven was horrified, and when the twins noticed him they woke their mother and asked, „whatês that?‰ she said „itês father.‰ the children laughed at the father because of his strange harsh voice and his feathers, but the mother told them to stop, and they did. raven felt he must create something since his wife had created humans so easily. first he flew to the benevolent. ones·dawn, sunset, evening and the others·for advice, but they had none to give. so he flew on to where some strange beings sat. they were to be the seeds, they said, of the new people, but they needed an earth. could raven cre- ate one? raven said he would try, and he and one of the man-seeds flew off to- gether. as he flew raven defecated and urinated, and his droppings became the mountains, valleys, rivers, oceans, and lakes. his excrement became the world we live in. the man-seed with him asked raven what the people would eat, and raven made plants and animals. eventually there were many men from the original seed, but there were no women until a little spider woman ap- peared and made women. the men did not understand about women, so raven with great pleasure demonstrated copu- lation with the women; later, also with pleasure, the men followed his example.
