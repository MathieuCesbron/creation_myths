taaroa, the great god, simply existed in space at the beginning of time before there was earth, sky, or humankind. in fact, he became the universe·the sands, rocks, and light. taaroa is the germ of life. he is within, under, above. the universe is his shell. it is said that taaroa lived in his egglike shell for a long time, but that finally he broke out of it and held it up to make the dome-sky, rumia. out of himself he made the world. he used his spine to make a mountain range, his ribs became hillsides, his fingernails became shells and scales, and his feathers became trees and plants. he kept his head to himself, however. taaroa made the gods and other things. just as taaroa had a shell, so does everything we know. the sky is a shell, earth is a shell for everything that lives in it, and the woman is the shell for human beings, because we are all born of woman. taaroa is uniqueness itself. he is the rock in earthês center, out of which the world grew; he is the earthês surface. he conjured the first man out of the earth, out of himself. this man was tiêi. he created the first woman, too. her name was hina; she could see backwards and forwards and she was good. tiêi was not good; he felt malice toward human beings. eventually there were wars in heaven among the gods and on earth among humans. this made taaroa and his assistant, tu (whom some say is the same as tiêi), very angry. they cursed creation. only the mitigation of the good hina prevented the destruction of the world. now, when storms come, hina makes them finally go away, and when leaves fall, hina makes new ones grow. although tiêi conjured up death for humans, hina said she would bring them back to life. this is why the people say that men, not women, brought death.
