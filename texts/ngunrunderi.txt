the great ancestor ngurunderi canoed down the murray river in search of his two runaway wives. a giant fish swam ahead of the ancestor, creating the present river out of the tiny stream that it used to be. when ngurunderi tried to spear the fish, he missed, but the spear became lenteilin, the long island. later, when the ancestor succeeded in spearing the fish, he cut it up, forming all the different fish the people find today. ngurunderi set up camp, but when he sensed the nearness of his wives, he left everything and went in pursuit of them; his canoe became the milky way. the wives heard their husband coming and abandoned their own camp in favor of a reed and grass raft, which turned into the reeds and grass trees of the area where they left it on the far side of lake albert. in kingston, still following his wives, the ancestor was challenged by the sorcerer, parampari. victorious after a long fight, ngurunderi burnt his adversaryÃªs body, which remains there today as the great granite boulders. ngurunderi continued along, creating islands with his spears and places like the longkuwar bluff with his club. the ancestor caught up with his wives on granite island, but they ran to cape jervis, from which point they ran toward the then-connected bit of land now called kangaroo island. that island was created when ngurunderi, in anger, caused waves to sweep across the connecting land, drowning not only the land but also his wives. they became the little rocky pages islands. the dreaming ended, and ngurunderi rose into the milky way.
