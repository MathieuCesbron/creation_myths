the genesis of the worlds or the beginning of newness before the beginning of the new-making áwonawílona the maker and container of all the all-father father solely had being there was nothing else whatsoever throughout the great space of the ages save everywhere black darkness in it and everywhere void desolation in the beginning of the new-made áwonawílona conceived within himself and thought outward in space whereby mists of increase steams potent of growth were evolved and uplifted thus by means of his innate knowledge the all-container made himself in person and form of the sun whom we hold to be our father and who thus came to exist and appear with his appearance came the brightening of the spaces with light and with the brightening of the spaces the great mist-clouds were thickened together and fell whereby was evolved water in water yea and the world-holding sea with his substance of flesh yépnane outdrawn from the surface of his person the sun-father formed the seed-stuff of twain worlds impregnating therewith the great waters and lo in the heat of his light these waters of the sea grew green and scums kyanashótsiyallawe rose upon them waxing wide and weighty until behold they became áwitelin tsíta the four-fold containing mother-earth and ápoyan tächu the all-covering father-sky the genesis of men and the creatures from the lying together of these twain upon the great world-waters so vitalizing terrestrial life was conceived whence began all beings of earth men and the creatures in the four-fold womb of the world áwiten téhuhlnakwi thereupon the earth-mother repulsed the sky-father growing big and sinking deep into the embrace of the waters below thus separating from the sky-father in the embrace of the waters above as a woman forebodes evil for her first-born ere born even so did the earth-mother forebode long withholding from birth her myriad progeny and meantime seeking counsel with the sky-father how said they to one another shall our children when brought forth know one place from another even by the white light of the sun-father now like all the surpassing beings píkwaiyin áhâi the earth-mother and the sky-father were hlímna changeable even as smoke in the wind transmutable at thought manifesting themselves in any form at will like as dancers may by mask-making thus as a man and woman spake they one to the other behold said the earth-mother as a great terraced bowl appeared at hand and within it water this is as upon me the homes of my tiny children shall be on the rim of each world-country they wander in terraced mountains shall stand making in one region many whereby country shall be known from country and within each place from place behold again said she as she spat on the water and rapidly smote and stirred it with her fingers foam formed gathering about the terraced rim mounting higher and higher yea said she and from my bosom they shall draw nourishment for in such as this shall they find the substance of life whence we were ourselves sustained for see then with her warm breath she blew across the terraces white flecks of the foam broke away and floating over above the water were shattered by the cold breath of the sky-father attending and forthwith shed downward abundantly fine mist and spray even so shall white clouds float up from the great waters at the borders of the world and clustering about the mountain terraces of the horizons be borne aloft and abroad by the breaths of the surpassing of soul-beings and of the children and shall hardened and broken be by thy cold shedding downward in rain-spray the water of life even into the hollow places of my lap for therein chiefly shall nestle our children mankind and creature-kind for warmth in thy coldness lo even the trees on high mountains near the clouds and the sky-father crouch low toward the earth-mother for warmth and protection warm is the earth-mother cold the sky-father even as woman is the warm man the cold being even so said the sky-father yet not alone shalt thou helpful be unto our children for behold and he spread his hand abroad with the palm downward and into all the wrinkles and crevices thereof he set the semblance of shining yellow corn-grains in the dark of the early world-dawn they gleamed like sparks of fire and moved as his hand was moved over the bowl shining up from and also moving in the depths of the water therein see said he pointing to the seven grains clasped by his thumb and four fingers by such shall our children be guided for behold when the sun-father is not nigh and thy terraces are as the dark itself being all hidden therein then shall our children be guided by lights--like to these lights of all the six regions turning round the midmost one--as in and around the midmost place where these our children shall abide lie all the other regions of space yea and even as these grains gleam up from the water so shall seed-grains like to them yet numberless spring up from thy bosom when touched by my waters to nourish our children thus and in other ways many devised they for their offspring the gestation of men and the creatures anon in the nethermost of the four cave-wombs of the world the seed of men and the creatures took form and increased even as within eggs in warm places worms speedily appear which growing presently burst their shells and become as may happen birds tadpoles or serpents so did men and all creatures grow manifoldly and multiply in many kinds thus the lowermost womb or cave-world which was ánosin téhuli the womb of sooty depth or of growth-generation because it was the place of first formation and black as a chimney at night time foul too as the internals of the belly thus did it become overfilled with being everywhere were unfinished creatures crawling like reptiles one over another in filth and black darkness crowding thickly together and treading each other one spitting on another or doing other indecency insomuch that loud became their murmurings and lamentations until many among them sought to escape growing wiser and more manlike the forthcoming from earth of the foremost of men then came among men and the beings it is said the wisest of wise men and the foremost the all-sacred master póshaiyankya he who appeared in the waters below even as did the sun-father in the wastes above and who arose from the nethermost sea and pitying men still won upward gaining by virtue of his innate wisdom-knowledge issuance from that first world-womb through ways so dark and narrow that those who seeing somewhat crowded after could not follow so eager were they and so mightily did they strive with one another alone then he fared upward from one womb cave to another out into the great breadth of daylight there the earth lay like a vast island in the midst of the great waters wet and unstable and alone fared he forth dayward seeking the sun-father and supplicating him to deliver mankind and the creatures there below the birth from the sea of the twain deliverers of men then did the sun-father take counsel within himself and casting his glance downward espied on the great waters a foam-cap near to the earth-mother with his beam he impregnated and with his heat incubated the foam-cap whereupon she gave birth to úanam achi píahkoa the beloved twain who descended first úanam éhkona the beloved preceder then úanam yáluna the beloved follower twin brothers of light yet elder and younger the right and the left like to question and answer in deciding and doing to them the sun-father imparted still retaining control-thought and his own knowledge-wisdom even as to the offspring of wise parents their knowingness is imparted and as to his right hand and his left hand a skillful man gives craft freely surrendering not his knowledge he gave them of himself and their mother the foam-cap the great cloud-bow and for arrows the thunderbolts of the four quarters twain to either and for buckler the fog-making shield which spun of the floating clouds and spray and woven as of cotton we spin and weave supports as on wind yet hides as a shadow hides its bearer defending also and of men and all creatures he gave them the fathership and dominion also as a man gives over the control of his work to the management of his hands well instructed of the sun-father they lifted the sky-father with their great cloud-bow into the vault of the high zenith that the earth might become warm and thus fitter for their children men and the creatures then along the trail of the sun-seeking póshaiyankya they sped backward swiftly on their floating fog-shield westward to the mountain of generation with their magic knives of the thunderbolt they spread open the uncleft depths of the mountain and still on their cloud-shield--even as a spider in her web descendeth--so descended they unerringly into the dark of the under-world there they abode with men and the creatures attending them coming to know them and becoming known of them as masters and fathers thus seeking the ways for leading them forth the birth and delivery of men and the creatures now there were growing things in the depths like grasses and crawling vines so now the beloved twain breathed on the stems of these grasses growing tall as grass is wont to do toward the light under the opening they had cleft and whereby they had descended causing them to increase vastly and rapidly by grasping and walking round and round them twisting them upward until lo they reach forth even into the light and where successively they grasped the stems ridges were formed and thumb-marks whence sprang branching leaf-stems therewith the two formed a great ladder whereon men and the creatures might ascend to the second cave-floor and thus not be violently ejected in after-time by the throes of the earth-mother and thereby be made demoniac and deformed up this ladder into the second cave-world men and the beings crowded following closely the two little but mighty ones yet many fell back and lost in the darkness peopled the under-world whence they were delivered in after-time amid terrible earth shakings becoming the monsters and fearfully strange beings of olden time lo in this second womb it was dark as is the night of a stormy season but larger of space and higher than had been the first because it was nearer the navel of the earth-mother hence named kólin tehuli the umbilical-womb or the place of gestation here again men and the beings increased and the clamor of their complainings grew loud and beseeching again the two augmenting the growth of the great ladder guided them upward this time not all at once but in successive bands to become in time the fathers of the six kinds of men the yellow the tawny gray the red the white the mingled and the black races and with them the gods and creatures of them all yet this time also as before multitudes were lost or left behind the third great cave-world whereunto men and the creatures had now ascended being larger than the second and higher was lighter like a valley in starlight and named áwisho tehuli--the vaginal-womb or the place of sex-generation or gestation for here the various peoples and beings began to multiply apart in kind one from another and as the nations and tribes of men and the creatures thus waxed numerous as before here too it became overfilled as before generations of nations now were led out successively yet many lost also as hitherto into the next and last world-cave tépahaian tehuli the ultimate-uncoverable or the womb of parturition here it was light like the dawning and men began to perceive and to learn variously according to their natures wherefore the twain taught them to seek first of all our sun-father who would they said reveal to them wisdom and knowledge of the ways of life--wherein also they were instructing them as we do little children yet like the other cave-worlds this too became after long time filled with progeny and finally at periods the two led forth the nations of men and the kinds of being into this great upper world which is called tékohaian úlahnane or the world of disseminated light and knowledge or seeing the condition of men when first into the world of daylight born eight years made the span of four days and four nights when the world was new it was while yet such days and nights continued that men were led forth first in the night that it might be well for even when they saw the great star móyächun hlána which since then is spoken of as the lying star mókwanosona they thought it the sun himself so burned it their eyeballs men and the creatures were nearer alike then than now black were our fathers the late born of creation like the caves from which they came forth cold and scaly their skins like those of mud-creatures goggled their eyes like those of an owl membranous their ears like those of cave-bats webbed their feet like those of walkers in wet and soft places and according as they were elder or younger they had tails longer or shorter they crouched when they walked often indeed crawling along the ground like toads lizards and newts like infants who still fear to walk straight they crouched as before-time they had in their cave-worlds that they might not stumble and fall or come to hurt in the uncertain light thereof and when the morning star rose they blinked excessively as they beheld its brightness and cried out with many mouth-motionings that surely now the father was coming but it was only the elder of the bright ones gone before with elder nations and with his shield of flame heralding from afar as we herald with wet shell scales or crystals the approach of the sun-father and when low down in the east the sun-father himself appeared what though shrouded in the midst of the great world waters they were so blinded and heated by his light and glory that they cried out to one another in anguish and fell down wallowing and covering their eyes with their bare hands and arms yet ever anew they looked afresh to the light and anew struggled toward the sun as moths and other night creatures seek the light of a camp fire yea and what though burned seek ever anew that light thus ere long they became used to the light and to this high world they had entered wherefore when they arose and no longer walked bended lo it was then that they first looked full upon one another and in horror of their filthier parts strove to hide these even from one another with girdles of bark and rushes and when by thus walking only upon their hinder feet the same became bruised and sore they sought to protect them with plaited soles sandals of yucca fiber
