when the world was finished, there were as yet no people, but the bald eagle was the chief of the animals. he saw the world was incomplete and decided to make some human beings. so he took some clay and modeled the figure of a man and laid him on the ground. at first he was very small but grew rapidly until he reached normal size. but as yet he had no life; he was still asleep. then the bald eagle stood and admired his work. “it is impossible,” said he, “that he should be left alone; he must have a mate.” so he pulled out a feather and laid it beside the sleeping man. then he left them and went off a short distance, for he knew that a woman was being formed from the feather. but the man was still asleep and did not know what was happening. when the bald eagle decided that the woman was about completed, he returned, awoke the man by flapping his wings over him and flew away. the man opened his eyes and stared at the woman. “what does this mean?” he asked. “i thought i was alone!” then the bald eagle returned and said with a smile, “i see you have a mate! have you had intercourse with her?” “no,” replied the man, for he and the woman knew nothing about each other. then the bald eagle called to coyote who happened to be going by and said to him, “do you see that woman?” try her first!” coyote was quite willing and complied, but immediately afterwards lay down and died. the bald eagle went away and left coyote dead, but presently returned and revived him. “how did it work?” said the bald eagle. “pretty well, but it nearly kills a man!” replied coyote. “will you try it again?” said the bald eagle. coyote agreed, and tried again, and this time survived. then the bald eagle turned to the man and said, “she is all right now; you and she are to live together.”
