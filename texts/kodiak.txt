raven brought light from the sky, and at the same time a bladder, containing a man and a woman, came down. by push- ing and stretching it, the man and woman made the bladder into the world. by pushing with their hands and feet, they made mountains. trees came into being when the man scattered his hair about. the woman urinated and spit to make the oceans, lakes, rivers, and ponds. the man made a knife out of one of the womanÃªs teeth and cut some wood to make wood- chips, which he then threw into the water to make fish. the man and the woman had a son, who played with a stone that became an island. they left another son on that island with a female dog that be- came his wife. these were the ancestors of the kodiak people.
