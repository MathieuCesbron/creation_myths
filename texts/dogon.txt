in the beginning, the world egg was shaken by seven huge stirrings of the universe. it divided into two birth sacs, each containing a set of twins who were fathered by the supreme being, amma, on the maternal egg (some say that the cosmic egg in this case was amma himself). in each placenta was a male and a female twin, but each twin contained both the male and female essence. the twins are known as the nummo. by some fluke, a male twin called yorugu broke out of one of the placentas before the proper time, and the piece of the sac from which he broke forth became the earth. when he tried to go back to the egg to retrieve his twin, she had disappeared. in fact, she had been placed in the other placenta with the other set of twins. yorugu went back down to the new earth and copulated with it·his own maternal placenta·but did not succeed in creating people. seeing this, amma sent the other twins down to procreate, and so it is that humans came from the original joining of brother, sister, and cousin twins.
