in the beginning there was only darkness, water, and the great god bumba. one day bumba, in pain from a stomach ache, vomited up the sun. the sun dried up some of the water, leaving the african land barren and empty. still in pain, bumba vomited up the moon, the stars, and then some animals: the leopard, the crocodile, and the turtle. after a while he got sick again, and finally vomit out some men, of which only one of them named yoko lima was white like bumba.
