in the beginning there were two worlds, an upper world where beings that resembled humans lived, and a lower world of the primeval waters and darkness where monsters and a few animals lived. a time came when a woman in the upper world, now known as sky woman, came down to the lower world and landed on the back of a turtle, which became the world. certain animals dove into the waters to find mud and that mud grew into earth on the turtleês back. sky woman gave birth to twins and then died. the twins were good mind and bad mind. good mind created the sun out of his motherês head and other cosmic bodies out of other parts of her body to give light to earth. good mind also made humans out of the mud as well as the plants and good animals. meanwhile, bad mind, who hated his brother, made dangerous animals and natural objects that brought pain and death to the people. finally, the twins fought for two days. good mind won and bad mind was sent down into the earth, from which place he still plagues humanity.
