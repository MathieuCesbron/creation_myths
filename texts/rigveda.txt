chariot bring us valour we call upon you for protection and happiness increase our intelligence at the time of battle the vishvadevas surya is the beautiful one he is the one who rules over everything and sucks out the juices from the earth the brother who is in the middle pervades everything the younger brother has a radiant back and his back is sprinkled with clarified butter i have seen the one who rules over the world through his seven sons suryas chariot has only one wheel but seven horses are harnessed to it although there seem to be seven horses there is actually only one horse with seven names the immortal and constant wheel has three naves it is through this wheel that the entire universe is established seven are the rays that sit astride the sunâ€™s chariot seven are the wheels and seven the horses that surya uses to drive through time seven are the forms of speech that worship the sun the seven sisters praise surya in the four directions he who has no bones created all living beings that have bones did anyone see him being created where then were to be found the life the blood and the soul of the earth who is the learned one who knows the answers to these questions i am the one whose learning is incomplete yet with all due humility i wish to know how the gods were created the learned ones used seven different types of thread to create the universe that can be seen and lived in he who created the six regions of the universe is prajapati he himself was not born who can comprehend the nature of prajapati i am the ignorant one but i wish to learn of this knowledge i will resort to the learned for wisdom surya is handsome and always mobile who knows of the origin of the sun let that learned one come here and reveal to me the knowledge the supreme rays of the sun suck up the water from the earth the water is borne by the sun and is then rained down on earth the earth is the mother and heaven is the father they had united to bring about the cosmic act of creation the earth bore the food grains in her womb may those who desire food grains worship the earth it is the sunâ€™s powers of preservation that bear up the earth the calf saw the many forms of the cow in the three worlds and began to call it was then that the seed was implanted in the womb of the earth prajapati alone bears aloft the three mothers and the three fathers he bears them but is above them all he is untouched by misery he knows the universe and rules over it but himself remains unattached the gods who populate heaven debate about the nature of prajapati twelve are the spokes on the suns wheel suryas wheel traverses heaven in the four directions it never wears thin o agni the seven hundred and twenty twin sons are always present the father has five feet and twelve forms some say that he traverses the further half of heaven others say that the chariot has seven wheels and six spokes all the worlds are gathered together in the movement of the wheel with the five spokes no matter what the weight may be the axle of the wheel never gets heated it travels perpetually through time but never breaks the wheel with the axle is like the universe and moves all the time it never breaks when nature was created the chariot began to be drawn by ten horses the suns radiance is shrouded in water and it is the sun who rules over all the worlds the seven elements were created at the same time they have the same origin that is prajapati six of these are connected to one another like twins they are like the sages who were created by the gods in six of them independent sacrifices are held depending on the occasion although the seven elements function independently they were created at the same time and have the same origin the rays of the sun have both masculine and feminine traits he who has the eyes of learning can see this he who is blind and ignorant never realises this learned sons know this wisdom and become so learned that they are as revered as fathers the cow has borne her calf in the region that is below heaven and above the earth who knows where the cow travels and who knows where the calf is born this much is certain that the calf is not born on earth the earth is below heaven and agni is the ruler of the earth heaven is above the earth and surya is the ruler of heaven who knows where divine minds originate he who knows the answer to this question is learned let him come here and tell us the answer the universe is in constant movement that which is near today is far tomorrow that which is far today is near tomorrow o soma you and indra have created the paths that you traverse along these paths your steeds draw your chariots thus it is that all the worlds are pulled the two birds have beautiful wings they sit on the same tree and are friends one of the birds eats the sweet fruit that grows on the tree the other does not eat the fruit it merely manifests itself the two birds with beautiful wings sit on the tree and pray for immortality with their words may the learned one who is the lord of the universe impart wisdom to my ignorant heart the two birds with beautiful wings sit on the tree that is the world they create all living beings and drink the honey that the tree provides sweet are the fruits that grow in the upper parts of the tree but he who does not know the nature of the paramatman does not get to eat these fruits gayatri is established on gayatri trishtupa is established on trishtupa and jagati is established on jagati he who knows this attains the immortality that knowledge confers riks have been composed in the gayatri metre many riks taken together constitute sama hymns hymns have also been composed in the trishtupa metre with different combinations of syllables the seven major metres can be formed surya is the speedy one through the sun prajapati ensured that there is always water in heaven the sun is united with the earth through the medium of rain it is said that the sun is like a verse that has three components it is surya who enhances the strength and greatness of prajapati for the sacrifice i call upon the cow which yields excellent milk i call upon the person who will milk the cow with his hands may savita grant me a plentiful supply of milk may the containers for boiling the milk be heated the cow calls to her beloved calf she yields the milk that will ensure prosperity and nourish the eight vasus this cow does not deserve to be killed milk will be provided for the ashvinis may the cow thrive so that prosperity is ensured the eyes of the calf are closed the cow calls and goes near the calf she licks its head and drags its mouth to her udders the cow calls her udders are warm she will satiate the calf with her milk the clouds have covered the suns rays form the four directions the clouds thunder the lightning that is in the clouds roars through their act of showering rain the clouds ensure that mankind thrives once it rains the clouds shine in their glory the atman is always mobile when life is over the atman forsakes the physical body that is dead and enters a new one the atman resides with the physical body but is itself immortal through its powers the atman moves all the time i have seen the sun which never falls down i have seen the sun which travels far and near i have seen the sun who is the protector the sun is the one whose energy blazes forth in the four directions the sun manifests himself in the world so vast is the universe that he who has created it does not know its full expanse when the atman tries to visualise the universe the universe seems to disappear the atman is born in the mothers womb it has many offspring and although the atman is itself immortal the physical body must eventually die heaven has created me and heaven is my preserver heaven is like my brother and is the fulcrum of my being this vast earth is my mother heaven and earth are like two vessels that face each other the sun is between the two it is the sun who implants the seed of food grains in the womb of the earth i ask you about the end of this earth i ask you about the centre of this universe i ask you about the origin of horses i ask you about the origin of speech this sacrificial altar is the end of the earth this sacrifice is the centre of the universe soma is the origin of all horses the brahman is the origin of all speech the essence of the universe is in seven sons they follow their own paths according to the instructions received from the supreme godhead the seven sons encompass the entire universe there is nothing that is beyond their reach i do not know what the atman may be compared to the atman is constrained inside the physical body but the mind is free to wander when the atman is united with the paramatman and realises the truth it is then that i grasp the significance of these words the atman is immortal but it remains with the mortal body through its own powers the atman attains higher births and lower ones the physical body and the atman are together but their destinations are different people can easily see the physical body but it is difficult to visualise the atman the paramatman is as vast as the sky and as constant as the syllables of the riks all the gods are to be found in the paramatman what use are the mantras of the vedas to someone who does not understand the nature of the great brahman he who knows the paramatman is the one who is the most learned he gets to sit in the most elevated of places o cows you do not deserve to be killed drink the purest of water and eat the best of grass may you have good fortune roam at will may we also have good fortune the cow which gives water has thundered sometimes the cow has one foot sometimes two sometimes four sometimes eight and sometimes nine it is the voice of heaven itself that thunders in a thousand syllables from the cow the oceans flow it is because of the cow that the four directions prosper the rains shower so that the entire universe can live from a great distance i have seen the many forms of powerful smoke there the brave ones are preparing the soma juice that is the source of strength this is what must always be done before any major task is embarked on the objects with three rays can be seen depending on the season one of them is lit once every year the second lights up the entire universe with its rays the movement of the third can be seen but its form itself remains invisible speech has been measured out in four divisions learned brahmanas are aware of this division three of these divisions remain secret and do not appear it is the fourth division that mankind are familiar with truth is one learned people refer to it by various names some call it indra others mitra others varuna and still others agni it is referred to as yama or as matarishvan it is also known as the goldenwinged garutman the rays of the sun carry water up into the sky the water next descends from the atmosphere in the form of rain it is this water that makes the earth wet there is a wheel which has twelve bounds around it the wheel has three naves and three hundred and sixty spokes only the learned ones know of this o sarasvati you are the source of happiness nurture us with all sorts of riches you are the possessor of jewels you are the one who grants jewels you grant the gifts that ensure our welfare may you look upon us with favour the gods themselves worship the paramatman the worship of the paramatman is the righteous path he who follows this dictum achieves the best of worlds where there is perpetual happiness it is there that the gods dwell during the space of a day it is the same water that goes up and comes down the clouds satisfy the earth and the fires of heaven i call upon surya for the sake of my protection he is the one who was born in heaven and he is the one who is always on the move he is the fulcrum of the water as he ensures that it rains he nourishes the herbs and satisfies the earth i worship surya rudra o father of the maruts confer happiness on us may we not be parted from the rays of the sun may our warriors be able

shyena when i was in the womb i learnt the account of the birth of the gods a hundred cities fortified with iron protected me but i swiftly emerged in the form of a falcon those dries could not surround me well i overcame the dries with my great powers the paramatman who is the creator of all that there is destroyed the enemies the paramatman killed the enemies who were as swift as the wind

would like to become your friend i welcome you with an open heart prajapati the creator has made us and is like our father he has desired that we may unite and have an excellent son otherwise the human race will not multiply yama replies i am indeed your friend and your companion but i do not desire to become your husband you are my sister and a brother cannot marry a sister besides this is not a secret place at all there are the sons of the demons who are mighty and strong they are everywhere and see all that happens on heaven and earth yami says you may be right such a union between a brother and a sister may be forbidden among men but such a union is not frowned upon or discouraged by the gods i wish to become your wife do not refuse me become my husband and grant me a son that i may bear in my womb yama replies i have never done anything like this before i always follow the path of truth i have never lied our parents are the gandharvas in heaven the adityas who rule over the water and the great pusha they are our best friends what you propose is not proper as our parents would disapprove of such a union yami says the great god tvashta is the creator of all that there is he is everywhere and bears up everything it is tvashta himself who decreed that we should be man and wife for there is no one else how can one go against the wishes of that great creator heaven and earth will approve of our marriage yama replies who knows the secrets of the first day of creation who knows how the universe was created who knows what relationships are sanctioned but what you propose is a sin it will lead to a downfall of the world that mitra and varuna preside over yami says all that i know is that i want you to become my husband we will be like the two wheels of a chariot united in action let us be man and wife yama replies the spies of the gods roam throughout the world night and day they never rest in one place their eyes are never closed if we commit a sin it will not escape them you will bring unhappiness to both of us go to some other man you and he can be like the two wheels of a chariot establish a relationship with him yami says let night and day grant us what we desire let the energy of the sun grant yama what he wants heaven and earth know that there is no one but the pair of us may yami become yamas wife there is no sin in this yama replies

says what sort of a brother do i have he cannot even satisfy his sisters wishes what sort of a sister am i i am forced to be unhappy even though i have a brother to succour me many are the words i have uttered i love you marry me yama replies unfortunately it is also true that i do not wish to marry you a brother who marries a sister commits a sin leave me alone go to some other man and find your pleasure with him o beautiful one your brother does not wish to become your husband yami says o yama you are indeed weak i have not been able to fathom what goes on in your mind do you have some other wife has some other woman tied you up the way a horse is tied up with a noose like a creeper entwines itself around a tree has some other woman embraced you yama replies o yami go and embrace some other man like a creeper embracing a tree may some other man embrace you may you be able to charm his mind may he be able to charm you may you be happy with him havirdhanas o carts these mantras

each of the steps four of these are trishtupa and other metres in which hymns are composed the fifth step is the sacred syllable om to whose chanting i perform the sacrifice on the altar of the sacrifice is placed the purified soma juice for the sake of the gods may death be banished may the immortal life that all living beings are entitled to not be destroyed the officiating priests are

waters i sing hymns in praise of your greatness i chant them at the house of the one who is performing the sacrifice twentyone are the rivers that flow seven for each of the three worlds the most famous of all these rivers is the sindhu it is the greatest o sindhu when you headed for the fertile plains varuna himself charted out a path for you excellent is the course that you follow you are the source of life for all living beings the thunder of your roar is heard in the sky above the earth your waters shine as they speed past the river sindhu thunders like a bull the sound it makes is like the clouds thundering before the onset of showers it has been said that the sindhu roars in the sky before descending on earth o sindhu a mother goes to her son with love in her heart a cow goes to a calf that has just been born to offer it milk like that other rivers head towards a confluence with the sindhu you are the leader of the rivers like a king is the leader of his army you are foremost among all the rivers o ganga o yamuna o sarasvati o shutudri o parushni o asikli o marudvridha o vitasta o sushoma o arjikiya o sindhu may you and the other seven rivers listen to our prayers o sindhu you wish to unite with the fastflowing gomati river but first you unite with the river named tushtama then you unite with the rivers susartu shveti kubha and mehatnu you unite with them as if you are riding on the same chariot with them white are the waters of the sindhu and they flow straight ahead fast is the sindhu and its speed cannot be stemmed the river is like a fleetfooted stallion it is as handsome as a beautiful woman sindhu possesses excellent horses beautiful chariots handsome clothing and golden ornaments its water is pure and it abounds in aquatic plants flowering trees line its banks sindhu possesses a chariot that brings happiness to this chariot steeds are harnessed sindhu will bring us food grains in that chariot the praise of the river is chanted at the time of a battle or a sacrifice great and famous is sindhus chariot it performs no violent deeds vishvakarma vishvakarma was the first priest he performed a sacrifice so that all the worlds and all the riches could be created he offered oblations to agni and to himself he is our father vishvakarma recited hymns so that the riches that are typified in heaven might be created first he created the universe next he merged into agni where was vishvakarma at the time of creation what did he look like then where did he start his act of creation how did he go about the task who knows why vishvakarma created the land masses of the earth why did he create the vast expanse of the sky who knows the answers to these questions vishvakarma is the paramatman he is omniscient his mouths his arms and his feet are everywhere it is this paramatman who created the three worlds with his own hands and feet he created heaven and earth at the same time he is the single and supreme godhead who oversees the functioning of the universe what was the forest and what the trees with which heaven and earth were fashioned o learned one search in your mind to see if you know the answer to this question think of the place where the supreme godhead resides it is there that he bears up the entire universe o vishvakarma you are the supreme creator you have a superior body you have a medium body and you have an inferior body may all these bodies make the elements our friends may water be mixed with your body to generate food grains may we obtain these food grains o vishvakarma the oblations increase your strength through your power and wisdom you bear up heaven and earth may oblations be offered to heaven and earth at the time of sacrifices those who do not perform sacrifices according to the proper rites may they be deluded vishvakarma is the lord of all riches at all sacrifices may he grant us heaven and earth vishvakarma is the lord of all speech he is as swift as the speed of thought we call upon vishvakarma so that he may offer us protection at the time of this sacrifice may he accept our oblations and grant us protection he is the one who is the source of all happiness and the source of all righteous action purusha purusha is the supreme godhead who has a thousand heads a thousand eyes and a thousand feet he surrounds the earth from the four directions one of his forms is merely ten fingers tall but it pervades creation it is the purusha who is the past and the future it is the purusha who is the present the purusha flourishes through food grains he is the lord of immortality and of divine bliss immense is the greatness of the purusha but there is a purusha who is superior to him as well all the elements that constitute the universe are merely like one foot of the purusha three of his footsteps provide immortality in heaven three of the purushas footsteps can be traced in heaven his form is divided into four quarters one fourth of his form is born again and again in the universe in the shape of living beings he created in the four directions being that live on food grains and beings that do not it is from the purusha that virat was created above virat there is the greater purusha virat was divided into various parts first the land and the worlds were created physical bodies emerged later the gods offered oblations to purusha and virat they performed a sacrifice the spring season was the clarified butter that was offered on the occasion of the sacrifice the summer season was the kindling and the autumn season was the oblation virat was the first to be created and deserved to be worshipped the gods and the sages saw virat and purusha and performed a sacrifice in their honour from that sacrifice were obtained curds and clarified butter the birds that fly in the sky were created the animals that live in the forests where vayu rules also emerged domesticated animals were created from the sacrifice emerged the mantras of the rig veda sama hymns various metres and the mantras of the atharva veda and the mantras of the yajur veda as well from that sacrifice were created horses and animals that have two tusks cows goats and sheep emerged the purusha who has been mentioned was described in all sorts of ways what was his mouth like where were his two arms where were his thighs and where were his feet such are the questions that are asked from the mouth of the purusha were born the learned brahmanas from his arms were bom the brave kshatriyas from his thighs were bom vaishyas and from his feet were bom the shudras the moon was created from the mind of the paramatman his eyes became the sun indra and agni were born from the mouth and vayu was created from the breath of life the atmosphere was made from the paramatmans navel his head became heaven and his feet the earth the directions were created from his ears in this fashion other worlds can be thought to have been created from other parts of the paramatmans anatomy seven were the fencings that encircled the place where the sacrifice was held twentyone bundles of kindling were used the gods performed the sacrifice and the paramatman himself was the sacrificial beast the gods began to perform the sacrifice with the aid of the purusha this was one of the most righteous acts ever performed the individuals who performed this righteous act reside in the most sacred of places it is certainly the case that learned men go to that most happy of places urvashi and pururava pururava o cruel wife stay here for a short while with your loving words may the two of us remain together for some time and converse the memory of the conversation that we have together will be a source of happiness in the days to come urvashi what purpose will these dry words serve what happiness can be gleaned from them i will disappear from your presence like the dawn o pururava return to your home i am as elusive as the wind pururava your separation has caused me much pain i can no longer lift an arrow from my quiver in pursuit of victory i am strong yet i find myself unable to rob my enemies of their cattle and riches i no longer find the power to carry on with my kingly duties i used to be like a lion whose roars struck terror into enemies on the field of battle alas all that is a thing of the past urvashi o dawn this urvashi wishes to cook food for her fatherinlaw i think of my husband often and i wish to go to his house night and day i think of my happy life with him o pururava i think of the joy we have had together i never had any feelings of jealousy for my cowives o brave warrior you were my lord pururava o urvashi you came to me with four of your friends their names were sujurni shreni sumnapi and hridechakshu but after you left they no longer come to visit me dressed in their gorgeous clothing i no longer hear the sounds of their voices like the voices of cows that have just calved urvashi o pururava when you were born the wives of the gods came to witness the birth the rivers that flow bowed down in salutation before the baby the gods gave you the strength to vanquish and kill enemies in battle when pururava came before the apsaras they fled before his energy it was as if deer were fleeing from a hunter yet pururava married this apsara and loved her urvashi had a fleeting presence like the lightning that flashes through the clouds my wishes will be fulfilled if i bear your son urvashi prays that the boy may have a long life o pururava the son that i bear you will rule over the whole world i warned you that my conditions would have to be met but you paid no heed you broke the conditions what is the point of sorrowing now pururava when will you give birth to a son who will address me as father he will come to me and ay who will wipe his tears then how can a son be born who will lead to his parents being separated when will your son frolic in the house of your fatherinlaw urvashi i will answer your questions when your son cries i will pray for his welfare i will make sure that he has no reason to cry i will send your son to you when he is bom it is time for you to return home now do not be ignorant it is impossible for me to be with you now pururava i was your beloved husband but i have fallen from that pedestal how does it matter if i die unprotected in distant lands how does it matter if i sleep on the ground or die in grief how does it matter if wolves devour me in the forests urvashi o pururava may you not die do not fall from your pedestal may you come to no harm and may wolves not bring you grief may you be preserved the love of women is but fickle their hearts are as cruel as those of wolves i adopted the form of a woman and lived among men i lived with you for the space of four years i loved you those memories will serve me well once i take leave of you pururava you are the joy of the atmosphere i am the generous pururava i am the performer of great deeds love you may i be united with you my heart is suffering at the thought of the impending separation do not go away please return to me urvashi o pururava you are the son of ila the gods are telling you that you are mortal but you will

creation only hiranyagarbha was there hiranyagarbha is the paramatman he is the one and only one who created the universe he is the one who bears aloft the earth and the atmosphere the paramatman is the source of all happiness it is him that we worship through our oblations he is the one who provides the knowledge of the atman he is the source of all strength all the worlds and all the gods follow his instructions it is his decree that is followed everywhere in the shadow of his refuge there is the seed of immortality to forsake the paramatman is to get to know death the paramatman is the source of all happiness it is him that we worship through our oblations his greatness makes him the lord of all things sentient and insentient he alone is the king of all things mobile and immobile he is the master of all bipeds and quadrupeds the paramatman is the source of all happiness it is him that we worship through our oblations the snowclad mountains have been created by his

itself we offer oblations to you so that our desires may be fulfilled grant us our wishes may we be the possessors of riches creation after the destruction there was no truth nor was there any untruth this was prior to the creation and there were no worlds then the objects that can be seen in the sky were not present who was it that covered up everything then where were all objects then where were the deep and silent waters at that time there was no death but nor was there immortality the sun and the moon were not there therefore there was no sense of night or day winds did not blow the brahman alone was there and it was the brahman alone who breathed through his powers apart from the brahman there was no other object this was the scene of destruction and chaos that prevailed before creation began everything was shrouded in darkness there was water all around all that could be seen around was the power of the brahman the time of creation came the idea of creation entered the paramatmans mind from the powers of his mind he first created the origin of seeds through the intelligence of his heart he next created the elements that constitute the universe it was the purusha who bore the seeds the power of greatness was created the rays that emanated from the paramatman spread out in all the directions above and below no man knows and no man can tell how creation began men are ignorant of who performed the act of creation even the learned ones were born only after creation started how can one oneself say how one was created no one is learned enough to know about the creation how does one know who bore all that was created the learned ones only know that the paramatman the creator resides above and even that knowledge is probably suspect the forests o goddess of the forests you can be seen in the forests and in the wilderness but you vanish before our eyes why are you not seen in towns and villages why do you go to the deserted forests do you not feel sacred there there are animals that roar in a loud voice there are animals that call in a soft voice when these two types of voices mingle the sound is that of a musical instrument being played it is as if the animals are chanting the praise of the goddess of the forest animals like cows also graze in the forest the trees and creepers that grow in the forest seem to set up a canopy above ones head when it is evening carts emerge from the forest they are laden with saplings and firewood it is almost as if the goddess of the forests is sending the carts home o goddess of the forest there a man is calling to his cows there is another chopping down firewood men who spend the night in the forests hear all sorts of sounds and are frightened so it is said the forests do not perform violent acts towards anyone in fact no one brings any harm to the forests the forest is the place where sweet fruits can be found one can eat those and live happily all sorts of fragrances can be found in the forest there is food in the form of fruits and roots the forest is a fertile region it is the mother of the deer is it not natural that i should sing the praise of the goddess of the forests shraddha it is through devotion that a fire is kindled in every household it is through devotion that oblations are offered at a sacrifice we praise shraddha it is the best of all riches o shraddha may the desires of one who gives alms be fulfilled o shraddha ensure the welfare of one who is generous listen to these words of mine and grant the desired fruit to those who are performing the sacrifice indra and the other gods decided to destroy the powerful demons you ensured that their desires were fulfilled like that may the wishes of those who are performing the sacrifice be granted gods and men pray to devotion so that they may be protected from strong winds they make up their minds that they will worship shraddha may shraddha grant them riches we pray to devotion in the morning we pray to devotion in the middle of the day we pray to devotion in the evening o shraddha grant devotion to those of us who live in this world shachi the sun which is established in heaven has risen it is indra himself who adopts the form of surya may my good fortune also dawn like the sun i know my husband and i know that he will be devoted to me i have the power to triumph over my cowives i will be victorious over them i am the chief of the wives like the head is the chief of the body i am learned and rise above like a flag even when i am angry i can persuade my husband to utter sweet words to

to this that my cowives have been subdued i do not have enemies i triumph over my enemies i am the victorious one who triumphs over all just as the power and the energy of enemies gets destroyed the power and energy of my cowives have been neutralised by me i am the one who defeats others i have defeated my cowives i will lord over indra and his relations such is my wish a charm against nightmares o lord of the mind do not cause me distraction while i sleep may you be banished go far away go and dwell in distant regions tell nirriti the goddess of sin to keep her distance i am still alive and my mind is preoccupied with thoughts of the material world let her not bring me grief everyone desires to have the best of rewards and they do attain what they want i ask the favour of yama the son of vivasvana may he not cause me unhappiness may my mind be able to think of various subjects when i am awake i think of the various misfortunes that may descend on me when i go to sleep i try to be free from fear and think of the good things that may happen to me but the various misfortunes plague me in my sleep o agni please ensure that such nightmares keep their distance o indra o brihaspati if i have committed sins against you please forgive me may those sins not give rise to nightmares may angirasa arid the learned varuna preserve me from all manner of sin today is the day when i will be victorious today is the day when i will attain my desires i have been cleansed of all sin i have been forgiven all the sins that i asleep or awake may have committed i have even been
