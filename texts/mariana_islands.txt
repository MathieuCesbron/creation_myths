in the beginning na arean was alone, „a cloud that floats in nothingness.‰ he did not exist in our way because there was not yet any existence. then a thought came from himself into his mind, and he made water in one hand and then mud, which he rolled into a ball and sat on as if it were an egg. after a while his head swelled until, on the third day, a man broke out. na arean greeted this new great thought as it came alive. „you are to be called na arean the younger and are to sit as you will in my right or left eye.‰ this the little man did until na arean told him to go down to the earth he had made and find its center. „but where is the center?‰ the man asked. na arean the elder took a tooth from his mouth and thrust it into the earth and said, „this is the center, the navel.‰ then na arean the younger went down through the hollow tooth. when he got to the center of the earth he found that things were all pressed together and dark, perhaps because his father had sat on the place. so he organized things until the heavens were where they belonged and the sun could send light through na areanês hollow tooth.
