in the beginning there was only water, the creator, mulungu, and the animals, until chameleon found a tiny man and a tiny woman in his otherwise empty fish net. he took the net and the strange creatures to mulungu, who instructed chameleon to let them go so they could growÂ·and grow they did. the new people learned to make fire, and often they terrified the animals by setting the forest on fire. they learned to hunt, and they killed and ate buffalo and other animals. as for the animals, they learned to flee in horror from humans. chameleon, for instance, fled into the trees. mulungu was so disgusted that he asked the spider to spin a rope so he could escape to the heavens. mulungu and all of the gods stay away now.
