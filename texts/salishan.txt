according to salish legend, our story began when the creator, the maker, put the animal people on this earth. the world was not yet fit for mankind because of many evils, so the creator sent coyote first –with his brother fox– to this big island (as the elders call this land) to free it of evils. the brothers were responsible for creating many geological formations and for providing special skills and knowledge for mankind to use. however, coyote –being coyote– left many faults such as greed, jealousy, hunger, envy, anger and many other imperfections that we know of today. at the core of this story is the fact that we are all made by the creator, and we must respect and love each other. all creation consists not only of mankind, but of all creations in the animal world, the mineral world, the plant world– all elements and forces of nature. each has a spirit that lives and must be respected and loved. the elders tell us that coyote and his brother are at the edge of this island, this land, waiting. when coyote and fox come back through here, it will be the end of our time. the end of this part of the universe if we do not live as one creation– all part of one big circle. we must always work or a time when there will be no evil, no racial prejudice, no pollution, when once again everything will be clean and all will be beautiful for the eye to behold– a time when spiritual, physical, mental, and social values are inter-connected to form a complete circle.
