a boy called pun miaupa fought with his father and ran away from home to his uncleês house. he announced to his uncle his desire to win halai auna (morning star) as his wife. his uncle, however, knowing the cruelty of wakara (moon, the girlês father), tried to talk his nephew out of the idea, but the boy insisted and left for wakaraês house. the uncle, a shaman, entered his nephewês heart to protect him. although wakara was not outwardly impolite, he set to work immediately to kill the boy by magically transporting his family group to the house of tuina, the sun. there he assumed that pun miaupa would die from the sunês poisoned tobacco. the shaman-uncle in the boyês heart saved him, however, and caused a great flood to drown everyone in wakaraês and tuinaês families except for halai auna. it was only because of the girlês unhappiness at the loss of her family that the magician relented and brought the evil ones back to life. everyone returned to the home of wakara, where he proposed a tree bending contest. because of the uncleês magic, wakara lost and was flung into the sky, where he remains today. pun miaupa and halai auna married, and the boy shouted out to wakara in the sky that he was doomed to stay where he was, growing old, then young, and then old again, forever and ever. thus the moon has its phases.
