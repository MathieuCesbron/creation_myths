in the beginning when the world was completely flooded, suelick made four powerful brothers named schodelick, swadick, hode, and stoodke. suelick told his brothers to create earth and people, so they left suelick and their home. schodelick, the eldest, who stands for something round or perhaps even a canoe anchor, came to skagit country and made man, woman, and some land. he also created fish for the rivers and lakes and showed the man and woman how to fish. he taught them how to clean and eat the fish also. then schodelick created all things that live: the trees, plants, and all the other animals. schodelick also taught man and woman how to use these. after finishing creation schodelick went to the waterfall near marble mount and told his brothers about his work. he told them he would be in the water near the big rock under the falls, and he dove into the water and sang and swam for a long time. he still lives there and represents the greatest power for the skagit. you can even walk by this place where he lives, and if you are there early enough in the morning, you might hear his song. when schodelick first dove into the water after creation he was hungry. thus the skagit people, who live by the power search or vision quest, also dive into the water hungry after many days of fasting in order to hear schodelick. without the power received from this search, the indian has no purpose and does not live long. all the young skagit people search for this power. schodelickÃªs three brothers went to okanagan, where they created the earth and people there, as well as the trees, plants, and animals. they taught these people the use of all the things in creation. hode, one of the brothers, represents fire to some, and the people he helped create worship fire. they become wild and can return to this world only by beating their heads in the fire. this is the true story of the beginning of these people.
