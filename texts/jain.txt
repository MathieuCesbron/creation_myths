those who suppose that a creator made the world and mankind are mis- led. if god is the creator, where was he before creation, and how could a non- material being make anything so material as this world? how could god have made the world with no materials to start with? those who suggest that god made the material first and then the world are trapped in a chicken-or-egg question. those who say raw materials came about naturally are just as trapped, because we might just as well say that the world could, therefore, have created itself and have come about naturally. if it is suggested that god created the world by a simple act of his will, one would have to ask how so perfect a being could have willed the creation of something else? there are many arguments to support the idea that it is foolish to assert that the world was created by god. why, for instance, would god kill his own creations, and if it is suggested that some of his creations are evil, one must ask why god would have created them in the first place, he being said to be perfect. the fact is: the world is as uncreated as time; it has no beginning and no end; it exists through its own being and is divided into heaven, earth, and hell.
