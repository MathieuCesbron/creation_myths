the first god was mula jadi na bolon. he took form ex nihilo as a trinity embodying the upper, middle, and lower worlds. the trinity was represented by a world tree as axis mundi or world center that linked the three parts of the cosmos. a bird in this world tree lay eggs, out of which emerged still another trinity charged with governing the three worlds. batara guru would govern the upper world, soripada the middle world, and mangalabulan the lower world. human beings came about in this way: sorbayati, batara guruês daughter, was betrothed to raja odap-odap, the son of mangalabulan. but when odap-odap preferred sorbayati's younger sister, si boru deak parujar, sorbayati leapt off the roof of her fatherês house during a musical performance and dance. her body turned into bamboo and rattan. si boru deak parujar did not want the lizard-like odap-odap, however, and managed to escape to the primordial waters of the middle world, where she created the earth on the back of the world serpent, naga podoha. then, when odap-odap took on human form, she agreed to marry him. this di- vine couple produced the first human beings twins named si raja ihat manisia and si boru ihat manisia. among their many children was si raja batak, the first of the batak people.
