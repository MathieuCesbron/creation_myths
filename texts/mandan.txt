first there was water and darkness everywhere. there was the creator and his companion, lone man. as they were walking about on the waters, the creator and lone man met a small being that turned out to be a duck. they asked her how she managed to live, and she explained that she took sustenance from something under the waters. creator asked her to show him the food, and she dove to the depths and returned with sand. the creator and lone man decided to create land from the sand. leaving some water between them·the missouri river·they began creating. north of the river the creator made lakes; northern animals like the elk, deer, and antelope; deep valleys; and high mountains. there was ample material for food and shelter for both humans and animals. farther south, lone man made plains-like country with a few lakes and rivers, along with animals such as the beaver, muskrat, and cattle of different kinds. then the two discussed their creations. the creator did not much like lone manês flat and somewhat forbidding landscape; it was not as suitable as his for providing food, clothing, and shelter. the creatorês animals seemed better adapted to the elements. lone man suggested that the people could make use of the creatorês superior creation first but that later his might become useful·and so it happened.
