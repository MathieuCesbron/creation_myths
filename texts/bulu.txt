in the beginning was membeêe, he who holds up the world. his son zambe was sent to create man, chimpanzee, gorilla, and elephant, each of whom he named after himself. one of the men he created was black and another was white. zambe gave the new zambes many fine things, such as water, gardening tools, and especially fire and the book. the new beings stirred the fire. when smoke got in the white manês eyes, he went away with the book. chimpan- zee left the fire and the other gifts and went into the forest to eat the fruit there. gorilla soon followed his lead, and el- ephant just stood around not thinking about much of anything. as for the black man, he continued to stir the fire, but he didnêt bother about the book. when the creator came for a visit he called his creatures together and asked what they had done with the things he had given them. when chimpanzee and gorilla said what they had done, zambe condemned them to having hairy bodies and big teeth and to live forever in the forest eating fruit. elephant was sent off in much the same manner. zambe now asked the black man where his book was. the black man re- plied that he had not had time to read it because he was tending the fire. „well,‰ said zambe, „thatês what you will con- tinue to do; you will have to spend your life working hard for others because you do not have book knowledge.‰ zambe turned to the white man and asked him what he had done with the gifts. „i have only read the book,‰ he said. „and that you shall continue to do,‰ answered the god. „you will know lots of things, but you will need the black man to take care of you because you will know nothing about keeping warm and growing food.‰ so it is that the animals live in the for- est, white men sit about reading a lot, and black men work hard but always have a good fire going.
