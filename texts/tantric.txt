before anything existed there was only a tiny bit of creative power. that power was female in nature and was the germ for the creation of the universe by the goddess time. the goddess created all things and became at once tired and filled with pleasure. she created the land, the seas, the plants, the animals, and she then worked on balancing the various aspects of creation so that they could multiply. then the goddess created the female form for herself and named herself kali. out of herself she created a male form, mahakala, and she taught him the pleasures of procreation. from the union of this male and female came the first humans, to whom kali and mahakala taught the tantric rituals of creative regeneration.
