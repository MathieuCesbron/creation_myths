when everything was water, iktome sent various animals to find earth below the primeval sea. only the muskrat succeeded; he floated up dead but there was earth in his claws, and out of that earth the creator made land. he then said there would be as many winter months as there were hairs in his fur robe. only the frog dared point out to iktome that this would be too many months of winter and suggested that seven cold months would be sufficient. when he continued to argue his point, iktome killed him, but even after death he signified seven months with his toes, and the creator-trickster gave in to the frogÃªs idea. finally, iktome made people and horses out of dirt, and he taught the assiniboine how to steal horses from other peoples.
