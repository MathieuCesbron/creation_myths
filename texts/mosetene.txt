dobittês heaven is a great raft that floats in space. it is guided by angel-like spirits. dobitt made humans out of clay and placed them on earth. then he sent his son keri as a white condor to see what was going on in the world, but the rope by which he was let down broke and keri was killed. dobitt made a fish out of his sonês head, and then went to the world himself to complete the creation. he made all the animals, poured out water from his basket to make rivers, lakes, and oceans, and taught humans how to survive. some say that dobitt arranged for the sky to be held up above the earth by a huge serpent.
