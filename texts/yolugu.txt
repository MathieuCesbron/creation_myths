in the beginning everything in nature existed except for humans. the prehuman ancestors of humans did exist, and these were called the djanggawul. they created ex nihilo by way of the aborigine dreaming. they possessed sacred thoughts as well as magical objects they carried in a bark canoe to the various parts of the country they wished to populate. there were three of these beingsÂ· djanggawul himself and his two sisters, bildjiwraroiju and miralaidj. djanggawul had a very long uncircumcised penis decorated with notches. the sisters had long clitorises. the sex organs of all three dragged along the ground leaving sacred markings. wherever the ancestors beached their canoe they left children made by the brother and the older sister, and later the younger sister as well. they conceived the children in the normal way, but it was necessary for djanggawul to lift the long clitorises of his mates to do so. wherever they stopped they also left dreamings in the form of objects, sacred stories, and ceremonial traditions. their sacred sex organs were central to the ceremonies and were represented by decorated poles. eventually the djanggawul came to jelangbara, the holy destination of their journey and the center to this day of their cult in northeastern arnhem land. they made camp in what is now a sacred waterhole made by the djanggawul when they inserted a sacred pole into the ground. today a spring flows from the hole. some say that when they got to arnhem bay they instituted the practice of circumcision. in any case, wherever they went they established their cult and left children who would later act together as husbands and wives, and so it was that the human beings of that area came to be.
