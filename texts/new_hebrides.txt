in the beginning there was only naareau the older existing in the void without the need to eat or sleep. then nareau decided to make a woman and she became real as nei teakea. then he thought of a man and the man, na atibu, the rock, became real and the man and the woman mated and produced naareau the younger. naareau the older then made a gift for his son. that gift was the darkness with sky and earth close together. naareau the older said his farewells and left his creation for good. now naareau the younger used a song spell to create a hollow between sky and earth, and a bat came out of the hollow. naareau asked the bat to dive back into the hollow and to tell him what was there. the bat did as he was told and reported that there were sleeping people there. wishing to know who the people were, naareau sent the bat to name the people and he did so. now naareau was ready to enter the dark world himself. with the bat as his guide he did so. by ordering the people to move, he helped them to gradually emerge from their deaf-mute sleeping state. but the people could not stand because of the lack of space between sky and earth. naareau sent one of the people, naabawe, to fetch the conger eel, riiki. riiki bit the man, so naareau used a song spell and the arms of an octopus as bait to trap him. he then made the conger eel separate sky and earth by pushing up the sky with his snout. with the help of the turtle and the octopus and more song spells in each of the four directions, sky was pushed away from earth and creation could continue in the world of light.
