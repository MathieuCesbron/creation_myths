n the beginning prophesying woman lived alone with utctsiti and naotsiti, her two daughters. at that time there was a lot of fog and four worlds: the yellow one at the bottom, the blue one next, fol- lowed by the red one, and the white one on top. tsityostinako and her daughters were still at the bottom. the daughters used a magic blanket, a manta, to create things. they sat on the floor with the manta open in front of them and a magic cane on it, and they created. prophesying woman was invis- ible but with them, giving them ideas. they sang to help the creation along and checked regularly under the manta to see what was going on there. later, when the people were created, they made their way up through the various worlds.
