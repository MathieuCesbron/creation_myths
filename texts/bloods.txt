napioa, who floated about on the first waters on a log, sent the fish, the frog, the lizard, and the turtle to get whatever there was down below. the fish, the frog, and the lizard did not come back, but the turtle did, and he carried some mud with him. he rolled up this mud into a ball, and it grew to become the earth. napioa made all of the world except for the white men, and nobody knows where they came from. after the earth was made it was time for humans. napioa made a woman, but he made her mouth the wrong way around and had to repair it before mak- ing some men and then more women. the men were afraid of the women, but old man told them what to do and the couples married. finally, napioa made the buffalo and taught people how to hunt them. now he lives far away in a southern sea.
