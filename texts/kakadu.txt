the giant wuraka walked through the western sea and came to allukaladi between the roe and bidwell mountains, which he made. then he moved on to other places in our land. meanwhile, imberombera also arrived from the sea at malay bay or wungaran. she met up with wuraka and asked him where he was going. he said he was heading through the bush to the rising sun in the east. to speak to each other they used the language of the people of port essington. wuraka carried his enormous penis over his shoulder, and it made him so tired that he sat down to rest rather than going along with imberombera as she suggested. where he rested, tor rock rose up. as for imberombera, her belly was full of children, and she carried bags of yams and a large stick. at marpur, near wurakaÃªs resting spot, she planted yams and left some spirit children who spoke iwaidja. she went on to many places, leaving spirit children and different languages.
