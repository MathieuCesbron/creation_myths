the people say that long sash, the evening star, once led the ancestors from the north to the place of the pueblos. they say that long sash was a great warrior and that he agreed to lead the people away from their marauding enemies. he warned them, however, that the journey would be hard. on the way, he acted as a culture hero, teaching them how to hunt and behave, and eventually they found a new country. whereas it had been dark where they lived before, in the new country it was light all the time. the people walked around in this country, and they quarreled and fought until long sash made them stop. he ordered them to rest a while before deciding whether to continue following him or to go another way. after they were rested, the people did as they still do today when they have to decide something·they gazed at the two bright stars that lie north of long sash. after doing that they decided to follow long sash. he made sure they followed with good feeling toward each other. after a while, everyone·including long sash·grew tired. long sash heard voices, and he fell into a long trancelike sleep to listen to them. when he awoke, he told the people he had been given signs. he said they would soon reach their proper destination and that, if they ever doubted, they should pray to the spirits above and look at his headdress for inspiration. he placed his headdress in the sky.
