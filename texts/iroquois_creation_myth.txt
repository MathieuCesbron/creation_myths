long before the world was created there was an island floating in the sky upon which the sky people lived they lived quietly and happily no one ever died or was born or experienced sadness however one day one of the sky women realized she was going to give birth to twins she told her husband who flew into a rage in the center of the island there was a tree which gave light to the entire island since the sun hadnt been created yet he tore up this tree creating a huge hole in the middle of the island curiously the woman peered into the hole far below she could see the waters that covered the earth at that moment her husband pushed her she fell through the hole tumbling towards the waters below water animals already existed on the earth so far below the floating island two birds saw the sky woman fall just before she reached the waters they caught her on their backs and brought her to the other animals determined to help the woman they dove into the water to get mud from the bottom of the seas one after another the animals tried and failed finally little toad tried and when he reappeared his mouth was full of mud the animals took it and spread it on the back of big turtle the mud began to grow and grow and grow until it became the size of north america then the woman stepped onto the land she sprinkled dust into the air and created stars then she created the moon and sun  the sky woman gave birth to twin sons she named one sapling he grew to be kind and gentle she named the other flint and his heart was as cold as his name they grew quickly and began filling the earth with their creations  sapling created what is good he made animals that are useful to humans he made rivers that went two ways and into these he put fish without bones he made plants that people could eat easily if he was able to do all the work himself there would be no suffering  flint destroyed much of saplings work and created all that is bad he made the rivers flow only in one direction he put bones in fish and thorns on berry bushes he created winter but sapling gave it life so that it could move to give way to spring he created monsters which his brother drove beneath the earth  eventually sapling and flint decided to fight till one conquered the other neither was able to win at first but finally flint was beaten because he was a god flint could not die so he was forced to live on big turtles back occasionally his anger is felt in the form of a volcano
