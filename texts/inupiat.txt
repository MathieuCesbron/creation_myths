raven, who was then shaped like a human being, woke up in heaven and suddenly became aware of himself in the primeval darkness. gradually he examined himself, feeling his mouth, nose, ears, and other body parts. he became aware, too, of the little bump on his forehead that later would become his beak. although he could not see anything in the darkness, raven discovered that he could move around, and he did so on his hands and knees. suddenly he came to the edge of an abyss and backed away. he found a little hard object and planted it in the clay that was all around him and a tree quickly grew. then a small bird lighted on him. it was a sparrow. but raven was lonely, so be made a being like himself out of clay. this being became violent, so raven threw him into the abyss. he would become tornaq, the first evil spirit. raven crawled back to his tree and found a whole forest. with the little sparrow he continued exploring and soon realized they were on an island of sorts. now curious about the abyss, raven asked sparrow to fly down to see what was there. after a long while the sparrow returned and said it was land in the process of forming. raven decided to make wings for himself like sparrowÃªs but bigger. this he did with sticks and then his body became feathered. now he was really the raven we know, and he flew down with sparrow to the new land. that land, of course, was our earth. as soon as he got to earth raven set about planting and creating. some say he made humans out of clay. others say he found the first human in a pod of one of his new plants. in any case, raven brought humans into being and he taught them to hunt, fish, and plant. and he taught them proper ways to behave. when he was finished with his work raven left the people for good, reminding them not to forget him, and on his way away he created the heavenly bodies, including the sun, so that there would be light on earth.
