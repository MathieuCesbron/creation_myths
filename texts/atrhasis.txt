When the gods instead of man
Did the work, bore the loads,
The gods' load was too great,
The work too hard, the trouble too much,
The great Anunnaki made the Igigi
Carry the workload sevenfold.
Anu their father was king,
Their counsellor warrior Ellil,
Their chamberlain was Ninurta,
Their canal-controller Ennugi.
They took the box (of lots) ... ,
Cast the lots; the gods made the division.
Anu went up to the sky,
And Ellil  took the earth for his people.
The bolt which bars the sea
Was assigned to far-sighted Enki.
When Anu had gone up to the sky,
And the gods of the Apsu had gone below,
The Anunnaki of the sky
Made the Igigi bear the workload.
The gods had to dig out canals,
Had to clear channels, the lifelines of the land,
The Igigi had to dig out canals,
Had to clear channels, the lifelines of the land.
The gods dug out the Tigris river (bed)
And then dug out the Euphrates.
in the deep
they set up
the Apsu
of the land
inside it
raised its top
of all the mountains
They were counting the years of loads;

the great marsh,
They were counting the years of loads.
For 3600 years they bore the excess,
Hard work, night and day.
They groaned and blamed each other,
Grumbled over the masses of excavated soil:
'Let us confront our the chamberlain,
And get him to relieve us of our hard work!
Come, let us carry the Lord,
The counsellor of gods, the warrior, from his
dwelling.
Come, let us carry Ellil,
The counsellor of gods, the warrior, from his
dwelling.'
Then Alia made his voice heard
And spoke to the gods his brothers,
'Come! Let us carry
The counsellor of gods, the warrior, from his
dwelling.
Come! Let us carry Ellil,
The counsellor of gods, the warrior, from his
dwelling.
Now, cry battle!
Let us mix fight with battle!'
The gods listened to his speech,
Set fire to their tools,
Put aside their spades for fire,
Their loads for the fire-god,
They flared up. When they reached
The gate of warrior Ellil's dwelling,
It was night, the middle watch,
The house was surrounded, the god had not
realized.
It was night, the middle watch,
Ekur was surrounded, Ellil had not realized.
Yet Kalkal was attentive, and had it closed,
He held the lock and watched the gate.
Kalkal roused Nusku.
They listened to the noise of the Igigi.
Then Nusku roused his master,

Made him get out of bed:
'My lord, your house is surrounded,
A rabble is running around your door!
Ellil, your house is surrounded,
A rabble is running around your door!'
Ellil had weapons brought to his dwelling.
Ellil made his voice heard
And spoke to the vizier Nusku,
'Nusku, bar your door,
Take up your weapons and stand in front of me.'
Nusku barred his door,
Took up his weapons and stood in front of Ellil.
Nusku made his voice heard
And spoke to the warrior Ellil,
'O my lord , your face is sallow as tamarisk!
Why do you fear your own sons?
O Ellil, your face is sallow as tamarisk!
Why do you fear your own sons?
Send for Anu to be brought down to you,
Have Enki fetched into your presence.'
He sent for Anu to be brought down to him,
Enki was fetched into his presence,
Anu king of the sky was present,
Enki king of the Apsu attended .
The great Anunnaki were present.
Ellil got up and the case was put.
Ellil made his voice heard
And spoke to the great gods,
'Is it against me that they have risen?
Shall I do battle ... ?
What did I see with my own eyes?
A rabble was running around my door!'
Anu made his voice heard
And spoke to the warrior Ellil,
'Let Nusku go out
And find out word of the lgigi
Who have surrounded your door.
A command . ..
To . . . '
Ellil made his voice heard

And spoke to the vizier Nusku,
'Nusku, open your door,
Take up your weapons and stand before me!
In the assembly of all the gods,
Bow, then stand and tell them,
"Your father Anu,
Your counsellor warrior Ellil,
Your chamberlain Ninurta
And your canal-controller Ennugiy
Have sent me to say,
Who is in charge of the rabble?
Who is in charge of the fighting?
Who declared war?
Who ran to the door of Ellil ?"'
Nusku opened his door,
Took up his weapons, went before Ellil
In the assembly of all the gods
He bowed, then stood and told the message.
'Your father Anu,
Your counsellor warrior Ellil,
Your chamberlain Ninurta
And your canal-controller Ennugi
Have sent me to say,
"Who is in charge of the rabble?
Who is in charge of the fighting?
Who declared war?
Who ran to the door of Ellil?" '

'Every single one of us gods declared war!
We have put a stop to the digging.
The load is excessive, it is killing us!
Our work is too hard, the trouble too much!
So every single one of us gods
Has agreed to complain to Ellil.'
Nusku took his weapons,
Went and returned to Ellil.
'My lord, you sent me to 
I went
I explained

Saying, "Every single one of us gods
Declared war.
We have put a stop to the digging.
The load is excessive, it is killing us,
Our work is too hard, the trouble too much,
So every single one of us gods
Has agreed to complain to Ellil! '"
Ellil listened to that speech.
His tears flowed.
Ellil spoke guardedly,
Addressed the warrior Anu,
' Noble one, take a decree
With you to the sky, show your strength
While the Anunnaki are sitting before you
Call up one god and let them cast him for
destruction!'
Anu made his voice heard
And spoke to the gods his brothers,
'What are we complaining of?
Their work was indeed too hard, their trouble was
too much.
Every day the earth resounded.
The warning signal was loud enough, we kept hearing the noise.

tasks

'While the Anunnaki are sitting before you,
And while Belet-ili the womb-goddess is
present,
Call up one and cast him for destruction!'
Anu made his voice heard and spoke to Nusku,
'Nusku, open your door, take up your weapons,
Bow in the assembly of the great gods, then
stand
And tell them,
"Your father Anu, your counsellor warrior Ellil,

Your chamberlain Ninurta and your canal controller Ennugi
Have sent me to say,
Who is in charge of the rabble? Who will be in
charge of battle?
Which god started the war?
A rabble was running around my door!"'
When Nusku heard this,
He took up his weapons,
Bowed in the assembly of the great gods, then
stood
,
And told them
'Your father Anu, your counsellor warrior Ellil,
Your chamberlain Ninurta and your canal controller Ennugi
Have sent me to say,
"Who is in charge of the rabble? Who is in
charge of the fighting?
Which god started the war?
A rabble was running around Ellil's door."'

Ea made his voice heard
And spoke to the gods his brothers,
'Why are we blaming them?
Their work was too hard, their trouble was too
much.
Every day the earth.
The warning signal was loud enough, we kept
hearing the noise.
There is
Belet-ili the womb-goddess is present
Let her create primeval man
So that he may bear the yoke,
So that he may bear the yoke, the work of Ellil,
Let man bear the load of the gods!'

'Belet-ili the womb-goddess is present,
Let the womb-goddess create offspring,

And let man bear the load of the gods!'
They called up the goddess, asked
The midwife of the gods, wise Mami,
'You are the womb-goddess to be the creator of
mankind!
Create primeval man, that he may bear the yoke!
Let him bear the yoke, the work of Ellil,
Let man bear the load of the gods!'
Nintu made her voice heard
And spoke to the great gods,
'It is not proper for me to make him.
The work is Enki's;
He makes everything pure!
If he gives me clay, then I will do it.'
Enki made his voice heard
And spoke to the great gods,
'On the first, seventh, and fifteenth of the month
I shall make a purification by washing.
Then one god should be slaughtered.
And the gods can be purified by immersion.
Nintu shall mix clay
With his flesh and his blood.
Then a god and a man
Will be mixed together in clay.
Let us hear the drumbeat forever after,
Let a ghost come into existence from the god's
flesh,
Let her proclaim it as his living sign,
And let the ghost exist so as not to forget (the
slain god).'
They answered 'Yes!' in the assembly,
The great Anunnaki who assign the fates.
On the first, seventh, and fifteenth of the month
He made a purification by washing.
Ilawela who had intelligence,
They slaughtered in their assembly.
Nintu mixed clay
With his flesh and blood.
They heard the drumbeat forever after.

A ghost came into existence from the god's flesh,
And she Nintu proclaimed it as his living sign.
v The ghost existed so as not to forget the slain god.
After she had mixed that clay,
She called up the Anunnaki, the great gods.
The Igigi, the great gods,
Spat spittle upon the clay.
Mami made her voice heard
And spoke to the great gods,
'I have carried out perfectly
The work that you ordered of me.
You have slaughtered a god together with his
intelligence.
I have relieved you of your hard work,
I have imposed your load on man.
You have bestowed noise on mankind.
I have undone the fetter and granted freedom.'
They listened to this speech of hers,
And were freed from anxiety, and kissed her feet:
'We used to call you Mami
But now your name shall be Mistress of All
Gods.'
Far-sighted Enki and wise Mami
Went into the room of fate.
The womb-goddesses were assembled.
He trod the clay in her presence;
SBV
She kept reciting an incantation,
For Enki, staying in her presence, made her recite
it.
When she had finished her incantation,
She pinched off fourteen pieces of clay,
And set seven pieces on the right,
Seven on the left.
Between them she put down a mud brick.
She made use of a reed, opened it to cut the
umbilical cord,
Called up the wise and knowledgeable
Womb-goddesses, seven and seven.
Seven created males,
Seven created females,

For the womb-goddess (is) creator of fate.
He ... -ed them two by two,
... -ed them two by two in her presence.
Mami made these rules for people
'In the house of a woman who is giving birth
The mud brick shall be put down for seven days.
Belet-ili, wise Mami shall be honoured.
The midwife shall rejoice in the house of the
woman who gives birth
And when the woman gives birth to the baby,
The mother of the baby shall sever herself.
A man to a girl her bosom
A beard can be seen
On a young man's cheek.
In gardens and waysides
A wife and her husband choose each other.'
The womb-goddesses were assembled
And Nintu was present. They counted the months,
Called up the tenth month as the term of fates.
When the tenth month came,
She slipped in a staff and opened the womb.
Her face was glad and joyful.
She covered her head,
Performed the midwifery,
Put on her belt, said a blessing.
She made a drawing in flour and put down a mud
brick:
'I myself created it, my hands made it.
The midwife shall rejoice in the house of the
qadistu-priestess.

Wherever a woman gives birth
And the baby' s mother severs herself,
The mud brick shall be put down for nine days.
Nintu the womb-goddess shall be honoured.
She shall call their ... "Mami".
She shall the womb-goddess,
Lay down the linen cloth.
When the bed is laid out in their house,
A wife and her husband shall choose each other.

Ishtar shall rejoice in the wife-husband
relationship
In the father-in-law's house.
Celebration shall last for nine days,
And they shall call Ishtar "Ishhara" .
On the fifteenth day, the fixed time of fate.
She shall call

A man
Clean the home
The son to his father
They sat and
He was carrying
He saw
Ellil
They took hold of ... ,
Made new picks and spades,
Made big canals
To feed people and sustain the gods.

600 years, less than 600, passed,
And the country became too wide, the people too
numerous.
The country was as noisy as a bellowing bull.
The God grew restless at their racket,
Ellil had to listen to their noise.
He addressed the great gods,
'The noise of mankind has become too much,
I am losing sleep over their racket.
Give the order that suruppu-disease shall break
out,

Now there was one Atrahasis
Whose ear was open to his god Enki.
He would speak with his god
And his god would speak with him.

Atrahasis made his voice heard
And spoke to his lord,
'How long will the gods make us suffer?
Will they make us suffer illness forever?'
Enki made his voice heard
And spoke to his servant:
'Call the elders, the senior men !
Start an uprising in your own house,
Let heralds proclaim . ..
Let them make a loud noise in the land:
Do not revere your gods,
Do not pray to your goddesses,
But search out the door of Namtara.
Bring a baked loaf into his presence.
May the flour offering reach him,
May he be shamed by the presents
And wipe away his " hand". '
Atrahasis took the order,
Gathered the elders to his door.
Atrahasis made his voice heard
And spoke to the elders,
'I have called the elders, the senior men!
Start an uprising in your own house,
Let heralds proclaim.
Let them make a loud noise in the land:
Do not revere your gods !
Do not pray to your goddesses!
Search out the door of Namtara.
Bring a baked loaf into his presence.
May the flour offering reach him;
May he be shamed by the presents
And wipe away his " hand" .'
The elders listened to his speech;
They built a temple for Namtara in the city.
Heralds proclaimed
They made a loud noise in the land.
They did not revere their god,
Did not pray to their goddess,
But searched out the door of Namtara,
Brought a baked loaf into his presence.

The flour offering reached him.
And he was shamed by the presents.
And wiped away his 'hand'.
The suruppu-disease left them,
The gods went back to their regular offerings

600 years, less than 600 passed.
600 years, less than 600, passed
And the country became too wide, the people too
numerous.
The country was as noisy as a bellowing bull.
The God grew restless at their clamour,
Ellil had to listen to their noise.
He addressed the great gods,
'The noise of mankind has become too much.
I am losing sleep over their racket.
Cut off food supplies to the people!
Let the vegetation be too scant for their hunger !
Let Adad wipe away his rain.
Below let no flood-water flow from the
springs.
Let wind go, let it strip the ground bare,
Let clouds gather but not drop rain,
Let the field yield a diminished harvest,
Let Nissaba stop up her bosom.
No happiness shall come to them.
Let their be dejected.'

'Call the elders, the senior men,
Start an uprising in your house,
Let heralds proclaim

Let them make a loud noise in the land :
Do not revere your gods!
Do not pray to your goddess!
Search out the door of Adad,
Bring a baked loaf into his presence.
May the flour offering reach him,
May he be shamed by the presents
And wipe away his "hand".'
Then he will make a mist form in the morning
And in the night he will steal out and make dew
drop,
Deliver the field of its produce ninefold, like
a thief.
They built a temple for Adad in the city,
Ordered heralds to proclaim
And make a loud noise in the land.
They did not revere their god(s),
Did not pray to their goddess,
But searched out the door of Adad,
Brought a baked loaf into his presence.
The flour offering reached him;
He was shamed by the presents
And wiped away his 'hand'.
He made mist form in the morning
And in the night he stole out and made dew drop,
Delivered the field of its produce ninefold, like
a thief.
The drought left them,
The gods went back to their regular offerings.

Not three epochs had passed.
The country became too wide, the people too
numerous.
The country was as noisy as a bellowing bull.
The gods grew restless at their noise.
Enlil organized his assembly again,
Addressed the gods his sons:
'The noise of mankind has become too much,
Sleep cannot overtake me because of their racket.
Command that Anu and Adad keep the (air)
above (earth) locked,
Sin and Nergal keep the middle earth locked.

As for the bolt that bars the sea,
Ea with his lahmu-creatures shall keep it locked'
He ordered, and Anu and Adad kept the (air) above
(earth) locked,
Sin and Nergal kept the middle earth locked.
As for the bolt that bars the sea,
Ea with his lahmu-creatures kept it locked.
Then the very wise man Atra-hasis
Wept daily.
He would carry a massakku-offering along the
riverside pasture,
Although the irrigation-water was silent.
Half-way through the night he offered a sacrifice.
As sleep began to overtake him
He addressed the irrigation-water:
'May the irrigation-water take it, may the river
carry it,
May the gift be placed in front of Ea my lord.
May Ea see it and think of me!
So may I see a dream in the night.'
When he had sent the message by water,
He sat facing the river, he wept,
The man wept facing the river
As his plea went down to the Apsu.
Then Ea heard his voice.
[He summoned his Zahmu-creaturesl and addressed
them.

Above, [rain did not fill the canals]
Below, flood-water did not flow from the springs.
Earth's womb did not give birth,
No vegetation sprouted
People did not look
The dark pastureland was bleached,
The broad countryside filled up with alkali.
In the first year they ate old grain
In the second year they depleted the storehouse.
When the third year came,
Their looks were changed by starvation,

Their faces covered with scabs like malt.
They stayed alive by life.
Their faces looked sallow.
They went out in public hunched,
Their well-set shoulders slouched,
Their upstanding bearing bowed.
They took a message [from Atrahasis to the gods].
In front of [the assembly of the great gods],
They stood [and
The orders [of Atrahasis they repeated]
]
In front of

600 years, less than 600 years, passed.
The country became too wide, the people too
numerous.]
He grew restless at their noise.
Sleep could not overtake him because of their
racket.
Ellil organized his assembly,
Addressed the gods his sons,
'The noise of mankind has become too much.
I have become restless at their noise.
Sleep cannot overtake me because of their racket.
Give the order that suruppu-disease shall break
out,
Let Namtar put an end to their noise straight
away!
Let sickness: headache, suruppu, asakku,
Blow in to them like a storm.'
They gave the order, and suruppu-disease did break
out.
Namtar put an end to their noise straight away.
Sickness: headache, suruppu, asakku,
Blew into them like a storm.
The thoughtful man, Atrahasis
Kept his ear open to his master Ea;
He would speak with his god,

Myths from Mesopotamia
[And his god] Ea would speak with him.
Atrahasis made his voice heard and spoke,
Said to Ea his master,
'Oh Lord, people are grumbling!
Your [sickness] is consuming the country!
Oh Lord Ea, people are grumbling!
[Sickness] from the gods is consuming the
country!
Since you created us
[You ought to] cut off sickness: headache,
suruppu and asakku . '
Ea made his voice heard and spoke,
Said to Atrahasis,
'Order the heralds to proclaim,
To make a loud noise in the land :
Do not revere your gods,
Do not pray to your goddesses!
withhold his rites!

Ellil organized his assembly,
Addressed the gods his sons,
'You are not to inflict disease on them again,
(Even though) the people have not diminishedthey are more than before!
I have become restless at their noise,
Sleep cannot overtake me because of their racket!
Cut off food from the people,
Let vegetation be too scant for their stomachs!
Let Adad on high make his rain scarce,
Let him block below, and not raise flood-water
from the springs!
Let the field decrease its yield,
Let Nissaba turn away her breast,
Let the dark fields become white,
Let the broad countryside breed alkali
Let earth clamp down her womb

So that no vegetation sprouts, no grain grows.
Let asakku be inflicted on the people,
Let the womb be too tight to let a baby out!'
They cut off food for the people,
Vegetation became too scant for their stomachs.

Blocked below, and did not raise flood-water from
the springs.

Nissaba turned away her breast,
The dark fields became white,
The broad countryside bred alkali.
Earth clamped down her womb:
No vegetation sprouted, no grain grew.
Asakku was inflicted on the people.
The womb was too tight to let a baby out.
Ea kept guard over the bolt that bars the sea,
Together with his lahmu-heroes.

When the second year arrived
They had depleted the storehouse.
When the third year arrived
[The people's looks] were changed [by starvation].
When the fourth year arrived
Their upstanding bearing bowed,
Their well-set shoulders slouched,
People went out in public hunched over.
When the fifth year arrived,

A daughter would eye her mother coming in;
A mother would not even open her door to her
daughter.
A daughter would watch the scales (at the sale of
her) mother,
A mother would watch the scales (at the sale of her)

When the sixth year arrived
They served up a daughter for a meal ,
Served up a son for food .

Only one or two households were left.
Their faces were covered with scabs like malt.
People stayed alive by life.
The thoughtful man Atrahasis
Kept his ear open to his master Ea.
He would speak with his god,
And his god Ea would speak with him.
He left the door of his god,
Put his bed right beside the river,

The order of Atrahasis
Saying, 'How long

He (Eilil) was furious with the Igigi,
'We, the great Anunna, all of us,
Agreed together on [a plan].
Anu and [Adad] were to guard [above],
I was to guard the earth [below].
Where Enki (went],
He was to undo the [chain and set (us) free],
He was to release [produce for the people].
He was to exercise [control by holding the
balance]. '
Ellil made his voice heard
And [spoke] to the vizier Nusku,
'Have the fifty lahmu-heroes fetched
for me!
Have them brought in to my presence!'
The fifty lahmu-heroes were fetched for him.
The warrior [Ellil] addressed them,
'We, the great Anunna, [all of us],
Agreed together on a plan.
Anu and Adad were to guard above,
I was to guard the earth below.
Where you [went],
[You were to undo the chain and set (us) free] ,

The warrior Ellil.
'Adad made his rain pour down,
filled the pasture land
And clouds veiled
Do not feed his people,
And do not give Nissaba's corn, luxury for
people, to eat.'
Then [the god] grew anxious as he sat,
In the gods' assembly worry gnawed at him.
[Enki (?)] grew anxious as he sat,
In the gods' assembly worry gnawed at him.

[They were furious with each other], Enki and Ellil.
'We, the great Anunna, all of us,
Agreed together on a plan.

'[You] imposed your loads on man,
You bestowed noise on mankind,
You slaughtered a god together with his
intelligence,
You must ... and [create a flood].
It is indeed your power that shall be used against
[your people!]
You agreed to [the wrong] plan!
Have it reversed!
Let us make far-sighted Enki swear an oath .'
Enki made his voice heard

And spoke to his brother gods,
'Why should you make me swear an oath?
Why should I use my power against my people?
The flood that you mention to me.
What is it? I don't even know!
Could I give birth to a flood?
That is Ellil' s kind of work!

Let him choose
Let Shullat and [Hanish] march [ahead]
[Let Erakal pull out] the mooring poles
Let [Ninurta] march, let him make [the weirs]
overflow.

The assembly
Do not listen to
The gods gave an explicit command.
Ellil performed a bad deed to the people.'
Atrahasis made his voice heard
And spoke to his master,

Atrahasis made his voice heard
And spoke to his master,
'Indicate to me the meaning of the dream,
let me find out its portent'
Enki made his voice heard
And spoke to his servant,
'You say, "I should find out in bed"
Make sure you attend to the message I shall tell
you!
Wall, listen constantly to me!
Reed hut, make sure you attend to all my words!
Dismantle the house, build a boat,

Reject possessions, and save living things.
The boat that you build
Roof it like the Apsu
So that the Sun cannot see inside it!
Make upper decks and lower decks.
The tackle must be very strong,
The bitumen strong, to give strength.
I shall make rain fall on you here,
A wealth of birds, a hamper of fish.'
He opened the sand clock and filled it,
He told him the sand (needed) for the Flood was
Seven nights' worth.
Atrahasis received the message.
He gathered the elders at his door.
Atrahasis made his voice heard
And spoke to the elders,
'My god is out of favour with your god.
Enki and [Ellil] have become angry with each
other.
They have driven me out of [my house].
Since I always stand in awe of Enki,
He told (me) of this matter.

I can no longer stay in
I cannot set my foot on Ellil's territory (again).
I must go down to the Apsu and stay with my god.
This is what he told me.'

The reed worker brought his stone
A child brought bitumen.
The poor fetched what was needed.

They were eating, they were drinking.
But he went in and out,
Could not stay still or rest on his haunches,
His heart was breaking and he was vomiting bile.
The face of the weather changed.
Adad bellowed from the clouds.
When he (Atrahasis) heard his noise,
Bitumen was brought and he sealed his door.
While he was closing up his door
Adad kept bellowing from the clouds.
The winds were raging even as he went up
And cut through the rope, he released the boat.

Anzu was tearing at the sky with his talons,
the land,
He broke the Flood [came out].
The kasiisu-weapon went against the people like an
army.
No one could see anyone else,
They could not be recognized in the catastrophe.

Anu went berserk,

Stayed parched and famished.
The goddess watched and wept,
Midwife of the gods, wise Mami:
'Let daylight
Let it return and !
However could I, in the assembly of gods,
Have ordered such destruction with them?
Ellil was strong enough to give a wicked
order.
Like Tiruru he ought to have cancelled that
wicked order!
I heard their cry levelled at me,
Against myself, against my person.
Beyond my control my offspring have become
like white sheep.
As for me, how am I to live in a house of
bereavement?
My noise has turned to silence.
Could I go away, up to the sky
And live as in a cloister ?
What was Anu's intention as decision-maker?
It was his command that the gods his sons
obeyed,
He who did not deliberate, but sent the Flood,
He who gathered the people to catastrophe

Nintu was wailing
'Would a true father have given birth to the
rolling sea

So that they could clog the river like
dragonflies ?
They are washed up like a raft on [a bank],
They are washed up like a raft on a bank in open
country!
I have seen, and wept over them!
Shall I (ever) finish weeping for them?'
She wept, she gave vent to her feelings,
Nintu wept and fuelled her passions.
The gods wept with her for the country.
She was sated with grief, she longed for beer (in
vain).
Where she sat weeping, (there the great gods) sat
too,
But, like sheep, could only fill their windpipes (with
bleating).
Thirsty as they were, their lips
Discharged only the rime of famine.
For seven days and seven nights
The torrent, storm and flood came on.

He put down
Provided food
The gods smelt the fragrance,
Gathered like flies over the offering.
When they had eaten the offering,
Nintu got up and blamed them all,
'Whatever came over Anu who makes the
decisions?
Did Ellil (dare to) come for the smoke offering?
(Those two) who did not deliberate, but sent the
Flood,
Gathered the people to catastropheYou agreed the destruction.
(Now) their bright faces are dark (forever).'
Then she went up to the big flies
Which Anu had made, and (declared) before the
gods,

'His grief is mine! My destiny goes with his!
He must deliver me from evil, and appease me!
Let me go out in the morning
Let these flies be the lapis lazuli of my necklace
By which I may remember it daily forever.'
The warrior Ellil spotted the boat
And was furious with the Igigi.
'We, the great Anunna, all of us,
Agreed together on an oath!
No form of life should have escaped!
How did any man survive the catastrophe?'
Anu made his voice heard
And spoke to the warrior Ellil,
'Who but Enki would do this?
He made sure that the [reed hut] disclosed the
order.'
Enki made his voice heard
And spoke to the great gods,
'I did it, in defiance of you!
I made sure life was preserved

Exact your punishment from the sinner.
And whoever contradicts your order

I have given vent to my feelings!'
Ellil made his voice heard
And spoke to far-sighted Enki,
'Come, summon Nintu the womb-goddess!
Confer with each other in the assembly. '
Enki made his voice heard
And spoke to the womb-goddess Nintu,
'You are the womb-goddess who decrees destinies.
to the people.
Let one-third of them be
Let another third of them be

In addition let there be one-third of the people,
Among the people the woman who gives birth yet
does
Not give birth (successfully);
Let there be the pasittu-demon among the people,
To snatch the baby from its mother's lap.
Establish ugbabtu, entu, egisitu-women:
They shall be taboo, and thus control childbirth.'

How we sent the Flood.
But a man survived the catastrophe.
You are the counsellor of the gods;
On your orders I created conflict.
Let the Igigi listen to this song
In order to praise you,
And let them record your greatness.
I shall sing of the Flood to all people:
Listen!
(Colophon)
The End.
