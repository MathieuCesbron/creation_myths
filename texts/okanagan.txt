old one created a woman as the world. he took the tiny earth that was first here, rolled it out, and pulled it like dough until it became earth woman. her head was in the west, where the rivers flow and where we go when we die. trees and other plants are her hair, the soil is her body, stones are her bones, and the wind is her breath. old one made the animals out of little pieces of her body. he blew on them to give them life. the indians, made of red clay, were among these new creatures. some of them were wicked, so old one sent his son·some say jesus·to put things in order. the people killed the son, however, and he went back up to old one. old one sent down coyote to try to put things to right. he was more successful·he killed monsters, taught the people things they needed to know, and divided them into tribes with different languages. he also made several foolish mistakes, however, so old one took the form of a wise old man and decided to complete the work of creation himself. he met coyote on the road, but coyote refused to recognize him when he said he was old one, chief of the world. only when old one picked up a river and moved it did coyote recognize him. then old one sent coyote away, thanking him for the work he had done. finally, old one taught the people how to pray so they could talk to him and he to them after he returned to the sky. he told the people that in time earth woman would be ancient enough for old one and the dead to return to her. then everyone would live together and revere earth woman as the great mother.
