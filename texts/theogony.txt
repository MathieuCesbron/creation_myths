invocation let me begin to sing of the muses of helikon who abide on the great and holy mount helikon around the deepblue spring with dainty feet they dance and around the altar of the mighty son of kronos washing their tender skin in the waters of the permessos or of the horse’s spring or of holy olmeios they set up their choral songsanddances on the highest point of helikon beautiful and lovely these these songsanddances they are nimble with their feet starting from there the top of helikon covered in plenty of mist invisible they go about at night sending forth a very beautiful voice singing of zeus the aegisbearer and lady hera of argos who walks about in golden sandals and the daughter of aegisbearing zeus athena and phoebus apollo and artemis who shoots her arrows and poseidon the earthholder and earthshaker and the honorable themis as well as aphrodite whose eyes go from side to side and hebe with the golden garland and beautiful dione and leto iapetos and kronos with his devious plans and the dawn eos and the great sun helios and the bright moon selene and the earth gaia and great okeanos and dark night nyx and the sacred genos of all the other immortals who are forever it was the muses who taught me hesiod their beautiful song it happened when i was tending flocks of sheep in a valley of helikon that holy mountain and the very first thing that the goddesses said to me those muses of mount olympus those daughters of zeus who holds the aegis was this wording mūthos “shepherds camping in the fields base objects of reproach mere bellies we know how to say many deceptive things looking like genuine etuma things but we also know how whenever we wish it to proclaim things that are true alēthea”that is how they spoke those daughters of great zeus who have words epea that fit perfectly together and they gave me a scepter skēptron a branch of flourishing laurel having plucked it and it was a wonder to behold then they breathed into me a voice audē a godlike one so that i may make glory kleos for things that will be and things that have been and then they told me to sing how the blessed ones makares  the gods were generated the ones that are forever and that i should sing them  the muses first and last the muses but why should i care about those things that keep going around an oak or a rock listen let me begin with the muses who please zeus the father with their song pleasing his great noos as he abides in olympus they tell of things that are that will be and that were before having their words fitted together as they sound forth and their voice pours forth without ever being worn down coming sweetly from their mouths glad is the palace of father zeus the loudthunderer over the delicate voice of the goddesses which reaches far and wide it echoes against the peaks of snowy olympus and the abodes of the immortals and they the muses send forth an immortal voice as they give kleos first to the genos of the gods a matter of reverence starting from the beginning telling about who were generated from earth gaia and the vast sky ouranos and what gods givers of good things were born from them next they the muses sing of zeus father of gods and men both when they begin and when they end their song they sing how much he is the most important of the gods and the greatest in power then again they sing of the genos of men and of the strong giants thus pleasing the noos of zeus who abides in olympus they are the olympian muses daughters of aegisbearing zeus they were born in pieria the father was zeus son of kronos their mother who mated with him was mnemosyne memory who rules over the heights of eleuther they were born to be the forgetting of misfortunes and the cessation of worries for nine nights did zeus the planner lie coupled with their mother entering her holy bed remote from the immortals when a year was up and the seasons came round as the months were waning and the many days were coming to fulfillment she mnemosyne gave birth to nine daughters all likeminded who have song on their minds in their breast they have a thūmos without worries there they are poised to descend from the topmost peak of snowy olympus that is where they have their bright dancingplaces and their beautiful abodes near them the kharites graces and himeros desire have their abodes amidst festivities and they the muses sending forth a lovely voice sing and make kleos for the norms nomoi and accustomed ways of all the immortals as they send forth a lovely voice anyway back then they went to olympus glorying in their beautiful voice with immortal song and the dark earth resounded all around them as they sang and the lovely steppings of their feet made a sound from below as they proceeded towards their father the one who is king in the sky with sole possession of the thunder and the gleaming thunderbolt having defeated with his power kronos his father each thing was well arranged by him as he assigned the norms and marked out the tīmai for the immortals  these things then the muses sang they who have abodes in olympus the nine daughters begotten by great zeus kleio clio and euterpe and thaleia thalia ‘festivity’ and melpomene and terpsichore and erato and polyhymnia and ourania urania and kalliope calliope that one calliope is the most important of them all  for she accompanies revered kings  whosoever among skynourished kings is honored timân by these daughters of great zeus  the muses  and is beheld by them when he is born  for such a man they pour sweet dew upon his tongue  and from his mouth flow sweet words the people  all of them look towards him as he sorts out diakrinein the divine laws themis plural  by way of straight judgments dikai and he speaking without stumbling  and with his powers of understanding can even put an end to a great quarrel neikos  it is for this reason that there are kings kings with good thinking phrenes namely because when people  are wronged in the assembly agorā they  the kings can turn things right around for them  quite easily speaking in a deflecting way by using soft words  and when he  the just king goes to a gathering agōn the people turn to him as if he were a god  because of his gentle command of respect aidōs and he stands out among the assembled  such is the sacred gift of the muses for humankind  for it is because of the muses and far shooting apollo  that there are singers aoidoi and players of the lyre kitharis on this earth  and it is because of zeus that there are kings blessed olbios is he whom the muses  love and a sweet voice audē flows from his mouth for when someone has sorrow penthos in his thūmos beset by new worries and is distressed by sorrow in his heart and when the singer poet  therapōn of the muses sings the klea of men who came before and the blessed gods who abide in olympus right away such a man forgets lēth his troubled thoughts and his cares he no longer remembers mnē quickly the gifts of the goddesses turn him away from these things be pleased and show your pleasure children of zeus by giving me a lovely song  give kleos to the holy genos of the immortals who have always been who were born of ge gaia and starry ouranos and of dark night—the gods who were nurtured by the salty pontos tell how the gods and the earth were generated at the very beginning and the rivers and the boundless pontos seething with waves  and the shining stars and the vast sky above tell of the gods givers of good things who were generated from them and how they divided up their wealth and how each one chose his or her tīmē  and how in the very beginning they came to possess olympus with its many ridges tell me these things olympian muses you who abide in olympus  tell it from the beginning about what was generated first from among them all the cosmogony first it was chaos and next broadbosomed earth ever secure seat of all the immortals who inhabit the peaks of snowcapped olympus and dark dim tartaros in a recess of earth havingbroadways  and eros love who is most beautiful among immortal gods eros that relaxes the limbs and in the breasts of all gods and all men subdues their reason and prudent counsel but from chaos were born erebos and black night and from night again sprang forth aether and day  whom she bore after having conceived by union with erebos in love and earth bore first like to herself in size starry sky that he might shelter her around on all sides that so she might be ever a secure seat for the blessed gods and she brought forth vast mountains lovely haunts of deities  the nymphs who dwell along the woodland hills she too bore also the barren sea rushing with swollen stream the pontos i mean without delightsome love but afterward having bedded with sky she bore deepeddying okeanos koios and kreios hyperion and iapetos  thea and rhea themis mnemosyne and phoebe with golden coronet and lovely tethys and after these was born youngest wily kronos most savage of their children and he hated his vigorgiving father then brought she forth next the kyklopes cyclopes having an overbearing spirit  brontes and steropes and stouthearted arges who gave to zeus his thunder and forged his lightnings now these were in other respects it is true like to gods but a single eye was fixed in their midforeheads and kyklopes was their appropriate name because  in their foreheads one circular eye was fixed strength biē and contrivances were in their works but again from earth and sky sprung other three sons great and mighty scarce to be mentioned kottos and briareus and gyas children exceeding proud  from the shoulders of these moved actively a hundred hands not brooking approach and to each above sturdy limbs there grew fifty heads from their shoulders castration of ouranos now monstrous strength is powerful joined with vast size for of as many sons as were born of earth and sky  they were the fiercest and were hated by their father from the very first as soon as any of these was born he would hide them all and not send them up to the light in a cave of the earth and sky exulted over the work of mischief while huge earth groaned from within  straitened as she was and she devised a subtle and evil scheme for quickly having produced a stock of white iron she forged a large sickle and gave the word to her children and said encouragingly though troubled in her heart “children of me and of a father madly violent if you  would obey me we shall avenge the baneful injury of your father for he was the first that devised acts of indignity” so spoke she but fear seized on them all nor did any of them speak till having gathered courage great and wily kronos addressed his dear mother thus in reply  “mother this deed at any rate i will undertake and accomplish since for our father ofdetestedname i care not for he was the first that devised acts of indignity” thus spoke he and huge earth rejoiced much at heart and hid and planted him in ambush in his hand she placed  a sickle with jagged teeth and suggested to him all the stratagem then came vast sky bringing night with him and eager for love brooded around earth and lay stretched on all sides but his son from out his ambush grasped at him with his left hand while in his right he took the huge sickle long and jaggedtoothed and hastily  mowed off the genitals of his father and threw them backwards to be carried away behind him aphrodite not for no purpose did they slip from his hand for as many gory drops as jetted forth from there earth received them all and when the years rolled round  she gave birth to stern furies erinyes and mighty giants gleaming in arms with long spears in hand and nymphs whom men call ashnymphs meliai over the boundless earth but the genitals as after first severing them with the steel he had cast them into the heaving sea from the continent  so kept drifting long time up and down the deep and all around kept rising a white foam from the immortal flesh and in it a maiden was nourished first she drew near divine kythera and thence came next to wavewashed cyprus then forth stepped an awesome beauteous goddess and beneath her delicate feet the grass throve around  gods and men name her aphrodite the foamsprung goddess and fairwreathed kytherea—the first because she was nursed in foam but kytherea because she touched at kythera and cyprusborn because she was born in wavedashed cyprus  and lover of smiles because she emerged out of the genitals and eros accompanied her and fair desire followed her when first she was born and came into the host of the gods and from the beginning this honor has she and this part has she obtained by lot among men and immortal gods  the amorous converse of maidens their smiles and wiles their sweet delights their love and blandishment night and her children now those sons their father mighty sky called by surname titans upbraiding those whom he had himself begotten and he was accustomed to say that outstretching their hands in recklessness they had wrought  a grave act but that  there should be vengeance for it hereafter night bore also hateful destiny and black fate and death she bore sleep likewise she bore the tribe of dreams these did the goddess gloomy night bear after union with none next again blame mōmos and care fullofwoes  and the hesperides whose care are the fair golden apples beyond the famous okeanos and trees yielding fruit and she produced the destinies moirai and ruthlessly punishing fates klotho lachesis and atropos who assign to men at their births to have good and evil  who also pursue transgressions both of men and gods nor do the goddesses ever cease from dread wrath before they have repaid sore vengeance to him whosoever shall have sinned then pernicious night also bore nemesis a woe to mortal men and after her she brought forth fraud and wantonlove  and mischievous old age and stubbornhearted eris but odious eris gave birth to grievous trouble and oblivion and famine and tearful woes contests and slaughters fights and homicides quarrelings neikos pl falsehoods words disputes  lawlessness and atē intimates one of the other and the oath which most hurts men on the earth whensoever one has sworn voluntarily a perjured oath pontos and his descendants and pontos begat trusty and truthful nereus eldest indeed of his children but men call him old  because he is unerring as well as mild neither does he forget the laws but knows just and gentle purposes and next again by union with earth great thaumas and strong phorkys and keto with faircheek and eurybia having in her breast a soul of adamant  from nereus and fairhaired doris daughter of okeanos perfect stream sprung lovely daughters of goddesses in the barren sea proto eukrante sao and amphitrite eudora thetis galene glauke  kymothoe speio thoe and charming halia graceful melite and eulimene and agaue pasithea erato and rosyarmed eunike doto and proto pherousa and dynamene nesaia and aktaia and protomedeia  doris and panope and beauteous galatea lovely hippothoe and rosyarmed hipponoe and kymothoe who along with kymatolege and neatankled amphitrite calms with ease the waves on the misty sea and the blasts of violent winds  kymo and eione and halimede with beauteous wreath and blithe glaukonome and pontoporeia leiagora euagore laomedeia polynome autonoe and lysianassa and euarne both lovely in shape and in beauty faultless  and psamathe graceful in person and divine menippe neso eupompe themisto pronoe and nemertes who has the mind of her immortal father these were born of blameless nereus fifty maidens versed in blameless labors  and thaumas wedded electra daughter of deepflowing okeanos she bore rapid iris and the fairtressed harpies aello and okypete who accompany the windblasts and birds with swift wings for they fly high above the earth  but to phorkys next keto offaircheek bore the graiai gray from their birth whom in fact immortal gods as well as men walking on the ground call graiai namely pemphredo handsomelyclad and enyo of saffronvestment and the gorgons who dwell beyond famous okeanos  in the most remote quarter nightward where are the clearvoiced hesperides stheno euryale and medusa havingsuffered sadly the latter was mortal but they the other two were immortal and ageless and it was with that one medusa that the azurehaired god lay in the soft meadow and amid the flowers of spring  from her too when as the tale is perseus had cut off the head up sprang huge khrysaor and the steed pegasus to the latter came his name because he was born near the springs of okeanos while the other had a golden sword in his hands and he indeed winging his flight away left earth the mother of flocks  and came to the immortals in zeus’s house he dwells bearing to counselor zeus thunder and lightning but khrysaor by union with kallirhoe daughter of famous okeanos begat threeheaded geryon indeed then mighty hēraklēs slew him  amidst his trailingfooted oxen in seagirt erythia on the very day when he drove the broadbrowed oxen to sacred tiryns having crossed the path of okeanos and having slain beyond famous okeanos orthos and the herdsman eurytion in a dusky stall  and she brought forth another monster irresistible in no way like mortal men or immortal gods in a hollow cavern the divine stubbornhearted echidna half nymph with dark eyes and fair cheeks and half on the other hand a serpent huge and terrible and vast  speckled and fleshdevouring beneath caves of sacred earth for there is her cavern deep under a hollow rock far from immortal gods as well as mortal men there have the gods assigned to her famous abodes to inhabit but she the destructive echidna was confined in arima beneath the earth  a nymph immortal and all her days insensible to age with her they say that typhaon associated in love a terrible and lawless ravisher for the darkeyed maid and she having conceived bore fiercehearted children the dog orthos first she bore for geryon and next  in the second place she brought forth their irresistible and ineffable fleshdevourer cerberus dog of hell with brazen voice and with fifty heads a bold and strong beast thirdly again she gave birth to the lernaean hydra subtle in destruction whom hera whitearmed goddess reared  implacably hating the mighty hēraklēs and zeus’s son hēraklēs named of amphitryon—along with warlike iolaos and by the counsels of pallas the despoiler—slaughtered it with ruthless sword but she echidna bore chimaera breathing resistless fire  fierce and huge fleetfooted as well as strong this monster had three heads one indeed of a grimvisaged lion one of a goat and another of a serpent a fierce dragon in front a lion a dragon behind and in the midst a goat breathing forth the dread strength of burning fire  pegasus with brave bellerophon slew her but she compelled by orthos brought forth in sooth the destructive sphinx a destruction to the kadmeians and the nemean lion whom hera zeus’s glorious consort reared and settled in the cornlands of nemea a woe to mankind  there abiding truly used he to devour the tribes of men while he held sway over tretos of nemea and over apesas but the might of strong hēraklēs subdued him and keto mingling in love with phorkys brought forth as youngestborn a terrible serpent  which in hidingplaces of dark earth guards allgolden apples in wide bounds such then is the brood of keto and phorkys descendants of ouranos children of tethys and okeanos but tethys to okeanos bore eddying rivers nile and alpheus and deepeddying eridanos strymon and maeander and istros offairstream  phasis rhesus and akhelōios with silverytide nessos and rhodios haliakmon and heptaporos granikos aisepos and divine simoeis peneios hermos and pleasantflowing kaikos and vast sangarios ladon parthenios  euenus and ardeskos and divine skamandros and she bore a sacred race of daughters who with king apollo and the rivers all earth over bring up men to manhood and have this prerogative from zeus namely peitho admete ianthe electra  doris and prymno and goddesslike  urania hippo and klymene rhodia and kallirhoe zeuxo and klytia iduia and pasithoe plexaure galaxaure lovely dione melobosis and thoe and fair polydora and  kerkeis in nature amiable and brighteyed plouto perseis ianeira akaste and xanthe and winsome petraia menesto and europa mētis eurynome and saffronrobed telesto krenaeis asia as well as desirekindling kalypsō  eudora tyche amphiro and okyrhoë and styx who truly is eldest of them all now these were born eldest daughters of okeanos and tethys there are however many others also for thrice a thousand are the taperingankled okeanosnymphs  who truly spreading far and near bright children of the gods haunt everywhere alike earth and the depths of the lake and again as many other rivers flowing with a ringing noise sons of okeanos whom august tethys bore it would be hard for mortal man to tell the names of all of them  but they who dwell around them know the names of each descendants of ouranos children of theia and hyperion and theia overcome in the embrace of hyperion brought forth the great sun and bright moon and dawn that shines for all thatdwellontheearth and for immortal gods who occupy the broad sky descendants of ouranos children of kreios and eurybia  eurybia too a goddess among goddesses bore to kreios after union in love huge astraios and pallas and perses who was transcendent in all knowledge and to astraios dawn brought forth the strongspirited winds argestes zephyr swiftspeeding boreas  and notos when she a goddess had mingled in love with a god and after them the goddess of morning produced the star morning star and the brilliant stars with which the sky is crowned and styx daughter of okeanos after union with pallas bore within the house zēlos and beauteousankled victory  and she gave birth to strength kratos and force biē illustrious children whose abode is not apart from zeus nor is there any seat or any way where the god does not go before them but always they sit beside deepthundering zeus for thus counseled styx imperishable okeanosnymph  at the time when the olympian lightener summoned all the immortal gods to broad olympus and said that whoso of the gods would fight with him against the titans none of them would he rob of his rewards but each should have the honor that he had earlier among the immortal gods  and he said that anyone who was unhonored or ungifted by kronos he would establish in honor and rewards according to justice then first came imperishable styx to olympus along with her children through the counsels of her father and zeus honored her and gave her exceeding gifts  for he ordained her to be the great oathwitness of the gods and her children to be dwellerswithher all their days and even as he promises he performed to them all for ever for he has power and reigns mightily descendants of ouranos children of phoebe and koios and next phoebe came to the muchbeloved couch of koios  then in truth having conceived a goddess by love of a god she bore darkrobed leto ever mild gentle to mortals and immortal gods mild from the beginning most kindly within olympus and she bore renowned asteria whom once perses  led to an ample  palace to be called his bride hekatē and she becoming pregnant brought forth hekatē whom zeus the son of kronos honored beyond all and provided for her splendid gifts to wit to hold a share of earth and of barren sea but she has obtained honor also from starry sky  and has been honored chiefly by immortal gods for even now when anywhere some one of men upontheearth duly propitiates them by doing worthy sacrifice he calls on hekatē and abundant honor very speedily attends him whose vows the goddess shall receive that is to say graciously  and to him she presents wealth for she has the power for as many as were born of earth and sky and received a share of honor of all these she has the lot neither did the son of kronos force any portion from her nor did he take away as many honors as she has obtained by lot among the elder gods the titans  but she has them as at the first the distribution was from the beginning nor because she is solebegotten has the goddess obtained less of honor and her prerogative on earth and in the sky and sea but even still much more seeing that zeus honors her and to whom she wills she is greatly present and benefits him  and he is distinguished whom she wants that way in the assembly among the people and when men arm for mortaldestroying war then the goddess draws nigh to whom she will kindly to proffer victory and to extend renown to them and in judgment she sits beside august kings  and propitiously again when men contend in the games there the goddess stands near these also and helps them and when he has conquered by strength and might a man carries with ease a noble prize and rejoicingly presents glory to his parents propitious is she also to be present with horsemen whenever she wishes  and to them who ply the rough silvery main and they pray to hekatē and the loudsounding earthshaker easily too the glorious goddess presents an ample spoil and easily is she accustomed to withdraw it when it is shown that is if she is so disposed in her mind and propitious along with hermes to increase the flock in the folds  the herds of cattle and the droves and broad herds of goats and flocks of fleecy sheep if she chooses in her heart she makes great from small and is accustomed to make less from being many thus in truth though being solebegotten from her mother she has been honored with rewards amidst all the immortals  and the son of kronos made her the nursingmotherofchildren who after her have beheld with their eyes the light of farseeing dawn thus is she from the beginning nursingmother and such are her honors descendants of ouranos children of rhea and kronos rhea too embraced by kronos bore renowned children hestia demeter and hera ofthegoldensandals  and mighty hādēs who inhabits halls beneath the earth having a ruthless heart and loudresounding poseidon and counseling zeus father of gods as well as men by whose thunder also the broad earth quakes and them indeed did huge kronos devour  namely every one who came to the mother’s knees from her holy womb with this intent that none other of the illustrious skyborn might hold royal honor among the immortals for he had heard from earth and starry sky that it was fated for him strong though he was to be subdued by his own child  through the counsels of mighty zeus wherefore he did not keep a careless watch but lying in wait for them kept devouring his own sons while a grief nottobeforgotten possessed rhea but when at length she was about to bear zeus  the father of gods as well as men then it was that she essayed to supplicate her parents dear  earth and starry sky to contrive a plan how she might without observation bring forth her son and avenge the furies of their father against his children whom great and wily kronos devoured and they duly heard and complied with their dear daughter  and explained to her as much as it had been fated should come to pass concerning king kronos and his stronghearted son and they sent her to lyktos to the fertile tract of crete when she was about to bear the youngest of her sons mighty zeus whom indeed vast earth received from her  to rear and nurture in broad crete thereupon indeed came she bearing him through the swift dark night to lyktos first and took him in her hands and hid him in a deep cave beneath the recesses of the divine earth in the dense and wooded aegean mount  but to the great prince the son of sky former sovereign of the gods she gave a huge stone having wrapped it in swaddling clothes which he then took in his hands and stowed away into his belly wretch as he was nor did he consider in his mind that against him for the future his own invincible and untroubled son was left instead of a stone  who was shortly about to subdue him by strength of hand and to drive him from his honors and himself to reign among the immortals quickly then throve the spirit and beauteous limbs of the king and as years came round having been beguiled by the wise counsels of earth  huge kronos wily counselor let loose again his offspring having been conquered by the arts and strength of his son and first he disgorged the stone since he swallowed it last this stone zeus fixed down upon the earth withitsbroadways in divine pytho delphi beneath the clefts of parnassus  to be a sēma thereafter a marvel to mortal men then he loosed from destructive bonds his father’s brethren the sons of sky whom his father had bound in his folly and they showed gratitude to him for his kindnesses and gave him the thunder and the smoking bolt  and lightning but earlier huge earth had hidden them trusting on these he rules over mortals and immortals descendants of ouranos children of iapetos and klymene iapetos moreover wedded the damsel klymene a fairankled okeanosdaughter and ascended into a common bed and she bore him atlas a stouthearted son  and brought forth exceedingfamous menoitios and artful prometheus full of various wiles and epimetheus oferringmind who was from the first an evil to gainseeking men for he first received from zeus the clayformed woman a virgin but the insolent menoitios wideseeing zeus  thrust down to erebos having stricken him with flaming lightning on account of his arrogance and overweening strength but atlas upholds broad sky by strong necessity before the clearvoiced hesperides standing on earth’s verge with head and unwearied hands  for this lot counseling zeus apportioned to him prometheus and wilyminded prometheus he bound in indissoluble bonds with painful chains having thrust them through the middle of a column and he urged against him an eagle withwingsoutspread but it kept feeding on his immortal liver while it would increase to a like size  allround by night to what the eagle withwingsoutspread had eaten during the whole day before indeed hēraklēs valiant son of fairankled alkmene slew this bird and repelled from the son of iapetos the baneful pest and  released him from his anxieties not against the wiles of highreigning olympian zeus  so that the kleos of thebesborn hēraklēs might be yet more than before over the manyfeeding earth thus he honors his very famous son through veneration for him and though incensed he zeus ceased from the wrath which he was harboring because he hēraklēs strove in plans against the almighty son of kronos prometheus zeus’s choice of the sacrifice  when the gods and mortal men were contending at mekone then did he prometheus set before him zeus a huge ox having divided it with ready mind studying to deceive the wisdom of zeus for here on the one hand he deposited the flesh and entrails with rich fat on the hide having covered it with the belly of the ox and there on the other hand he laid down  having well disposed them with subtle craft the white bones of the ox covering them with white fat then it was that the father of gods and men addressed him “son of iapetos farfamed among all kings how unfairly good friend you have divided the portions”  thus spoke rebukingly zeus skilled in imperishable counsels and him in his turn wily prometheus addressed laughing low but he was not forgetful of subtle craft “most glorious zeus greatest of everliving gods choose which of these your inclination within your breast bids you” he spoke in subtlety  but zeus knowing imperishable counsels was aware in fact and not ignorant of his guile and was boding in his heart evils to mortal men which also were about to find accomplishment then with both hands he lifted up the white fat but he was incensed in mind and wrath came around him in spirit  when he saw the white bones of the ox arranged with guileful art and thenceforth the tribes of men on the earth burn to the immortals white bones on fragrant altars then cloudcompelling zeus addressed him greatly displeased “son of iapetos skilled in wise plans beyond all  you do not good sir yet forget subtle craft” thus spoke in his wrath zeus knowing imperishable counsels from that time forward ever mindful of the fraud he did not give the strength of untiring fire to wretched mortal men who dwell upon the earth  but the good son of iapetos cheated him and stole the farseen splendor of untiring fire in a hollow fennelstalk but it stung highthundering zeus to his heart’s core and incensed his spirit when he saw the radiance of fire conspicuous among men prometheus pandora and the lineage of women  forthwith then he fashioned evil for men in requital for the fire bestowed for from the earth the famous hephaistos halting in both feet fashioned the image of a modest maiden through the counsels of the son of kronos and the goddess glancingeyed athena girded and arrayed her in silverwhite raiment  and from her head she held with her hands a curiously embellished veil a marvel to look upon and pallas athena placed around her about her head lovely garlands freshbudding with meadowflowers and around her head she set a golden coronet which renowned hephaistos lame with both feet had made himself  having wrought it carefully by hand out of compliment to zeus his father on it had been wrought many curious monsters a marvel to view as many as in great abundance the continent and the sea maintain many of these he introduced and much elegance beamed from it of wondrous beauty like to living animals gifted with sounds  but when he had wrought a beauteous evil instead of good he led her forth even where were the rest of gods and men exulting as she was in the adornment of the gleamingeyed  daughterofastrongfather and wonder seized immortal gods as well as mortal men when they beheld a deep snare against which man’s craftiness is in vain  from her is the race of tender women for from her is a pernicious race tribes of women a great source of hurt dwell with mortal men helpmates not in consuming poverty but in surfeit and as when in closeroofed hives bees  feed drones sharers in bad works the former through the whole day till sunset are busy day by day and make white combs while the latter remaining within in the closeroofed hives reap the labors of others for their own stomachs  just as to mortal men highthundering zeus gave women as an evil accomplices of painful toils another evil too did he provide instead of good to wit whosoever shunning marriage and the ills that women work declines to marry and has come to old age pernicious  through want of one to tend his final days he lives not it is true in lack of subsistence but when he is dead distant kindred divide his possessions while to whomsoever on the other hand the lot of marriage shall have fallen and he has had a good wife congenial to his heart to him then forever ill contends with good to be with him  but whoso finds a baneful breed lives with an incessant care to spirit and heart within his breast and it is an irremediable woe thus it is not possible to deceive or overreach the mind of zeus for neither did prometheus helpful son of iapetos  escape from beneath his severe wrath but a great chain by necessity constrains him very knowing though he is titanomachy but when first their father became angry in spirit against briareus kottos and gyes he bound them with a strong bond admiring their overweening courage and also their form  and bulk and he made them dwell beneath the roomy earth then they in grief dwelling beneath the earth sat at the verge on the extremities of vast earth very long afflicted having a great woe at heart but them the son of kronos and other immortal gods  whom fairhaired rhea bore in the embrace of kronos by the counsels of earth brought up again to light for she recounted to them at large everything how they should along with those briareus kottos and gyes gain victory and splendid glory long time then they fought incurring soulvexing toil  the titan gods and as many as were born from kronos in opposition to each other in stout conflicts the one side the glorious titans from lofty othrys and the other the gods givers of good things whom rhea the fairhaired had borne to kronos in union with him from olympus  they then in souldistressing battle one party with the other were fighting continuously more than ten years nor was there any riddance or end of severe contention to either party and the completion of the war was extended equally to either but when at length zeus set before them all things agreeable  to wit nectar and ambrosia on which the gods themselves feed a noble spirit grew in the breasts of all and when they had tasted the nectar and delightful ambrosia then at length the father of gods and men addressed them “hear me illustrious children of earth and sky  that i may speak what my spirit within my breast prompts me to speak for now a very long space we are fighting each in opposition to other concerning victory and power all our days the titan gods and as many of us are sprung from kronos  now you must show against the titans in deadly fight both mighty force and hands invincible in gratitude for our mild lovingkindness namely  after how many sufferings you came back again to the light from afflictive bondage through our counsels from the murky gloom” thus he spoke and him in turn blameless kottos addressed in answer  “excellent lord you do not tell things unlearned by us but we too are aware that your wisdom is excellent and excellent your intellect and that you have been to the immortals an averter of terrible destruction and back again from harsh bonds have we come from the murky darkness through your thoughtful care  o royal son of kronos having experienced treatment unhopedfor wherefore also now with steadfast purpose and prudent counsel we will protect your might in dread conflict fighting with the titans in stout battles” thus he spoke and the gods givers of good approved  when they had heard his speech and their spirit was eager for battle still more than before and they stirred up unhappy strife all of them female as well as male on that day both titan gods and as many as had sprung from kronos and they whom zeus sent up to light from erebos beneath the earth  terrible and strong having overweening biē from the shoulders of these a hundred hands outsprung to all alike and to each fifty heads grew from their shoulders over their sturdy limbs they then were pitted against the titans in deadly combat  holding huge rocks in their sturdy hands but the titans on the other side made strong their phalanxes with alacrity and both sides were showing work of hand and biē at the same time and the boundless sea reechoed terribly and earth resounded loudly and the broad sky groaned  being shaken and vast olympus was convulsed from its base under the violence of the immortals and a severe quaking came to murky tartaros namely a hollow sound of countless chase of feet and of strong battlestrokes to such an extent did they hurl groancausing weapons  and the voice of both sides reached the starry sky as they cheered for they came together with a great warcry no longer did zeus restrain his fury but then forthwith his heart was filled with fierceness and he began also to exhibit all his biē then from the sky and from olympus  he went forth lightening continually and the bolts close together with thunder and lightning flew duly from his sturdy hand whirling a sacred flash in frequent succession while allaround lifegiving earth was crashing in conflagration and the immense forests on all sides crackled loudly with fire  all land was boiling and the streams of okeanos and the barren sea hot vapor was circling the earthborn titans and the incessant blaze reached the divine denseatmosphere while flashing radiance of thunderbolt and lightning was bereaving their eyes of sight strong though they were  fearful heat likewise possessed chaos and it seemed to look at face to face with the eye and to hear the sound with the ear just as if earth and the broad sky from above were threatening to meet for such an exceeding crash would have arisen from earth falling in ruins and the sky dashing it down from above  such a din there rose when the gods clashed in strife the winds too at the same time were stirring up quaking and dust together thunder and lightning and smoking bolt shafts of the mighty zeus and they were bearing shout and battlecry into the midst one of another then a terrible noise  of dreadful strife was roused strength of prowess was put forth and the battle was inclined but before that time assailing one another they were fighting incessantly in stern conflict now the others among the first ranks roused the keen fight kottos briareus and gyes insatiable in war  who truly were hurling from sturdy hands three hundred rocks close upon each other and they had overshadowed the titans with missiles sent them beneath  the broadwayed earth and bound them in painful bonds having conquered them with their hands overhaughty though they were  as far beneath under earth as the sky is from the earth for equal is the space from earth to murky tartaros depiction of the underworld for nine nights and days also would a brazen anvil be descending from the sky and come on the tenth to the earth and nine days as well as nights again would a brazen anvil be descending  from the earth to reach on the tenth to tartaros around it moreover a brazen fence has been forged and about it night is poured in three rows around the neck but above spring the roots of earth and barren sea there under murky darkness the titan gods  lie hidden by the counsels of cloudcompelling zeus in a dark dreary place where are the extremities of vast earth these may not go forth for poseidon has placed above them brazen gates and a wall goes round them on both sides there dwell gyes and kottos and highspirited briareus  faithful guards of aegisbearing zeus and there are the sources and boundaries of dusky earth of murky tartaros of barren sea and starry sky all in their order boundaries oppressive and gloomy which also even gods abhor  a vast chasm not even for a whole round of a year would one reach the ground after having first been within the gates but gusts of wind following one upon the other would bear him onward hither and thither distressing him and dreadful even to immortal gods is this prodigy there the dread abodes of gloomy night  stand shrouded in dark clouds in front of these the son of iapetos stands and holds broad sky with his head and unwearied hands unmovedly where night and day also drawing near are accustomed to salute each other as they cross the vast  brazen threshold the one is about to go down within while the other comes forth abroad nor ever does the abode constrain both within but constantly one at any rate being outside the dwelling wanders over the earth while the other again being within the abode awaits the season of her journey until it comes  the one having a farseeing light for menontheearth and the other destructive night having sleep the brother of death in its hands being shrouded in hazy mist and there the sons of obscure night hold their habitation sleep and death dread gods nor ever does  the bright sun look upon them with his rays as he ascends the sky or descends from the sky of whom indeed the one tarries on the earth and the broad surface of the sea silently and soothingly to men but of the other iron is the heart and brazen is his  ruthless soul within his breast and whomsoever of men he may have first caught he holds and he is hostile even to immortal gods there in the front stand the resounding abodes of the infernal god of mighty hādēs and awesome persephone besides and a fierce dog keeps guard in front a ruthless dog  and he has an evil trick those who enter he fawns upon with his tail and both ears alike yet he allows them not to go forth back again but lies in wait and devours whomsoever he may have caught going forth outside the gates of strong hādēs and dread persephone  there too dwells a goddess odious to immortals dread styx eldest daughter of backflowing okeanos and apart from the gods she inhabits renowned dwellings vaulted by huge rocks and round about on all sides they are strengthened to sky by silver columns  and seldom goes the fleetfooted daughter of thaumas iris on a message over the broad back of the sea namely when by chance strife and quarrel  shall have arisen among the immortals and whosoever of them that hold olympian dwellings utters falsehood then also zeus is accustomed to send iris to bring  from far in a golden ewer the great oath of the gods the renowned water cold as it is which also runs down from a steep and lofty rock but in abundance beneath the roomy earth flows a branch of okeanos from the sacred river through black night and a tenth portion has been assigned to it  in nine portions indeed rolling around earth and also the broad back of the sea with silver whirlpools he okeanos falls into the brine but the other part flows forth from a rock a great bane to the gods whosoever of immortals that occupy the top of snowy olympus shall have offered of this as a libation and sworn over it a false oath  lies breathless until the completion of a year nor ever comes near the repast of nectar and ambrosia but also lies breathless and speechless on a strewn couch and a baneful stupor overshrouds him but when he has fulfilled his malady until the full year  then another after another more severe trouble succeeds for him and for nine years he is parted from the everliving gods nor ever does he mix with them in council nor in feasts for nine whole years but in the tenth he mingles again in the assemblies of the gods immortal who occupy olympian dwellings  such a grave oath have the gods made the imperishable water of styx that ancient water which also runs through a very rugged tract there too are the sources and boundaries of dusky earth and murky tartaros and barren sea and starry sky all in order  boundaries oppressive and gloomy which also even gods abhor and there are gleaming gates and a brazen threshold unshaken and fixed upon farextending foundations selfgrowing and before it outside of all the gods beyond gloomy chaos the titans dwell  but the famed allies of loudcrashing zeus inhabit dwellings under the foundations of the okeanos namely kottos and gyes briareus indeed for his part strong as he was deepsounding earthshaker made his soninlaw and gave him to wife his daughter kymopolia typhonomachy  but when zeus had driven the titans out from sky huge earth bore her youngestborn son typhoeus by the embrace of tartaros through golden aphrodite whose hands indeed are apt for deeds on the score of strength and untiring the feet of the strong god and from his shoulders  there were a hundred heads of a serpent a fierce dragon playing with dusky tongues and from the eyes in his wondrous heads fire was gleaming as he looked keenly in all his terrible heads too were voices  sending forth every kind of sound ineffable for a while they would utter sounds so as for the gods to understand and at another time again the voice of a loudbellowing bull untamable in force and proud in utterance at another time again that of a lion possessing a daring spirit at another yet again they would sound like to whelps wondrous to hear  and at another he would hiss and the lofty mountains resound and in fact it was then that there would have been done a deed past remedy and he yes he would have reigned over mortals and immortals unless the father of gods and men had quickly observed him harshly then he thundered and heavily  and terribly the earth reechoed around and the broad sky above and the sea and streams of okeanos and the abysses of earth but beneath his immortal feet vast  olympus trembled as the king rose up and earth groaned beneath and the heat from both caught the darkcolored sea  both of the thunder and lightning and fire from the monster the heat arising from the thunderstorms winds and burning lightning and all earth and sky and sea were boiling and huge billows roared around the shores about and around beneath the violence of gods and unallayed quaking arose  hādēs trembled monarch over the dead beneath and the titans under tartaros standing about kronos trembled also on account of the unceasing tumult and dreadful contention but then zeus had raised high his wrath and had taken his arms his thunder and lightning and smoking bolt leapt up  and smote him from olympus and scorched allaround all the wondrous heads of the terrible monster but when at length he had quelled it after having smitten it with blows the monster fell down lamed and huge earth groaned but the flame from the lightningblasted monster flashed forth  in the mountainhollows hidden and rugged when he was stricken and much was the vast earth burnt and melted by the boundless vapor like pewter heated by the craft of youths and by the wellbored meltingpit or iron which is the hardest of metals  subdued in the dells of the mountain by blazing fire melts in the sacred earth beneath the hands of hephaistos so was earth melted in the glare of burning fire then troubled in spirit he hurled him into wide tartaros now from typhoeus is the strength of winds moistblowing  except the southwest the north and argestes and zephyr who also indeed are a race from the gods a great blessing to mortals but the others being random gusts breathe over the sea and these falling upon the darksome deep rage with baneful gusts a great hurt to mortals  and now here now there they blow and scatter ships and destroy sailors nor is there any relief from ill to men who encounter them on the sea but these again over the boundless flowery earth spoil the pleasant works of earthborn men  filling them with dust and wearisome uproar descendants of kronos children of zeus but when the blessed makar gods had fulfilled their labor ponos and contended with the titans perforce on the score of honors tīmai then it was i say that they urged farseeing zeus by the advice of earth to rule and reign  over immortals and he duly distributed honors tīmai amongst them and zeus king of the gods made mētis first his wife mētis most wise of deities as well as mortal men but when at last she was about to give birth to athena gleamingeyed goddess then it was that having by deceit beguiled her mind  with flattering words he placed her mētis within his own belly by the advice of earth and of starry sky for thus they persuaded him lest other of everliving gods should possess sovereign honor in the room of zeus for of her mētis it was fated that wise children should be born  first the glancingeyed tritonian maiden having equal might and prudent counsel with her father and then she mētis was going to give birth to a son as king of gods and men with an overbearing spirit if it had not been for the fact that zeus deposited her first in his own belly  that the goddess might indicate to him both good and bad next he wedded bright themis who bore the hōrai eunomia dikē and blooming peace who care for their works for mortal men and the fates moirai to whom counseling zeus gives most honor  klotho lachesis and atropos who also give to men good and evil to possess and eurynome daughter of okeanos having a very lovely form bore him the faircheeked kharites graces aglaia and euphrosyne and winsome thalia  from whose eyelids also as they gazed dropped love unnerving limbs and sweetly too they look from under their brows but he came to the couch of muchnourishing demeter who bore him whitearmed persephone her whom hādēs ravished from her mother and sage zeus gave her away and next he was enamored of beautifulhaired  mnemosyne of whom were born to him the muses nine
