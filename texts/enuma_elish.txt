shall never lose its power it shall crush thy foe o lord spare the life of him that putteth his trust in thee but as for the god who began the rebellion pour out his life then set they in their midst a garment and unto marduk their firstborn they spake may thy fate o lord be supreme among the gods to destroy and to create speak thou the word and thy command shall be fulfilled command now and let the garment vanish and speak the word again and let the garment reappear then he spake with his mouth and the garment vanished again he commanded it and the garment reappeared when the gods his fathers beheld the fulfillment of his word they rejoiced and they did homage unto him saying  marduk is king they bestowed upon him the scepter and the throne and the ring they give him an invincible weapony which overwhelmeth the foe go and cut off the life of tiamat and let the wind carry her blood into secret places after the gods his fathers had decreed for the lord his fate they caused him to set out on a path of prosperity and success he made ready the bow he chose his weapon he slung a spear upon him and fastened it he raised the club in his right hand he grasped it the bow and the quiver he hung at his side he set the lightning in front of him with burning flame he filled his body he made a net to enclose the inward parts of tiamat the four winds he stationed so that nothing of her might escape the south wind and the north wind and the east wind and the west wind he brought near to the net the gift of his father anu he created the evil wind and the tempest and the hurricane and the fourfold wind and the sevenfold wind and the whirlwind and the wind which had no equal he sent forth the winds which he had created the seven of them to disturb the inward parts of tiamat they followed after him then the lord raised the thunderbolt his mighty weapon he mounted the chariot the storm unequaled for terror he harnessed and yoked unto it four horses destructive ferocious overwhelming and swift of pace  were their teeth they were flecked with foam they were skilled in  they had been trained to trample underfoot   mighty in battle left and right his garment was  he was clothed with terror with overpowering brightness his head was crowned then he set out he took his way and toward the raging tiamat he set his face on his lips he held   he grasped in his hand then they beheld him the gods beheld him the gods his fathers beheld him the gods beheld him and the lord drew nigh he gazed upon the inward parts of tiamat he perceived the muttering of kingu her spouse as marduk gazed kingu was troubled in his gait his will was destroyed and his motions ceased and the gods his helpers who marched by his side beheld their leaders and their sight was troubled but tiamat  she turned not her neck with lips that failed not she uttered rebellious words  thy coming as lord of the gods from their places have they gathered in thy place are they  then the lord raised the thunderbolt his mighty weapon and against tiamat who was raging thus he sent the word thou art become great thou hast exalted thyself on high and thy heart hath prompted thee to call to battle  their fathers  their thou hatest thou hast exalted kingu to be thy spouse thou hast him that even as anu he should issue deerees thou hast followed after evil and against the gods my fathers thou hast contrived thy wicked plan let then thy host be equipped let thy weapons be girded on stand i and thou let us join battle when tiamat heard these words she was like one posessed she lost her reason tiamat uttered wild piercing cries she trembled and shook to her very foundations she recited an incantation she pronounced her spell and the gods of the battle cried out for their weapons then advanced tiamat and marduk the counselor of the gods to the fight they came on to the battle they drew nigh the lord spread out his net and caught her and the evil wind that was behind him he let loose in her face as tiamat opened her mouth to its full extent he drove in the evil wind while as yet she had not shut her lips the terrible winds filled her belly and her courage was taken from her and her mouth she opened wide he seized the spear and burst her belly he severed her inward parts he pierced her heart he overcame her and cut off her life he cast down her body and stood upon it when he had slain tiamat the leader her might was broken her host was scattered and the gods her helpers who marched by her side trembled and were afraid and turned back they took to flight to save their lives but they were surrounded so that they could not escape he took them captive he broke their weapons in the net they were caught and in the snare they sat down the  of the world they filled with cries of grief they received punishment from him they were held in bondage and on the eleven creatures which she had filled with the power of striking terror upon the troop of devils who marched at her he brought affliction their strength he them and their opposition he trampled under his feet moreover kingu who had been exalted over them he conquered and with the god dugga he counted him he took from him the tablets of destiny that were not rightly his he sealed them with a seal and in his own breast he laid them now after the hero marduk had conquered and cast down his enemies and had made the arrogant foe even like and had fully established ansars triumph over the enemy and had attained the purpose of nudimmud over the captive gods he strengthened his durance and unto tiamat whom he had conquered he returned and the lord stood upon tiamats hinder parts and with his merciless club he smashed her skull he cut through the channels of her blood and he made the north wind bear it away into secret places his fathers beheld and they rejoiced and were glad presents and gifts they brought unto him then the lord rested gazing upon her dead body while he divided the flesh of the   and devised a cunning plan he split her up like a flat fish into two halves one half of her he stablished as a covering for heaven he fixed a bolt he stationed a watchman and bade them not to let her waters come forth he passed through the heavens he surveyed the regions thereof and over against the deep he set the dwelling of nudimmud and the lord measured the structure of the deep and he founded esara a mansion like unto it the mansion esara which he created as heaven he caused anu bel and ea in their districts to inhabit  he marduk made the stations for the great gods the stars their images as the stars of the zodiac he fixed he ordained the year and into sections he divided it for the twelve months he fixed three stars after he had  the days of the year  images he founded the station of nibir the planet jupiter to determine their bounds that none might err or go astray he set the station of bel and ea along with him he opened great gates on both sides he made strong the bolt on the left and on the right in the midst thereof he fixed the zenith the moongod he caused to shine forth the night he entrusted to him he appointed him a being of the night to determine the days every month without ceasing with the crown he covered him saying at the beginning of the month when thou shinest upon the land thou commandest the horns to determine six days and on the seventh day to divide the crown on the fourteenth day thou shalt stand opposite the half when the sungod on the foundation of heaventhee the  thou shalt cause to  and thou shalt make his  unto the path of the sungod shalt thou cause to draw nigh and on the  day thou shalt stand opposite and the sungod shall  to traverse her way  thou shalt cause to draw nigh and thou shalt judge the right  to destroy  the gods his fathers beheld the net which he had made they beheld the bow and how its work was accomplished they praised the work which he had done then anu raised the  in the assembly of the gods he kissed the bow saving  it is and thus he named the names of the bow saving longwood shall be one name and the second name shall be  and its third name shall be the bowstar in heaven shall it then he fixed a station for it now after the fate of he set a throne in heaven  when marduk heard the word of the gods his heart prompted him and he devised a cunning plan he opened his mouth and unto ea he spake that which he had conceived in his heart he imparted unto him my blood will i take and bone will i fashion i will make man that man may i will create man who shall inhabit the earth that the service of the gods may be established and that their shrines may be built but i will alter the ways of the gods and i will change their paths together shall they be oppressed and unto evil shall they and ea
