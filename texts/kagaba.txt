the great mother who bore us in the beginning is the mother of all that is. she made our songs, our seed, our nations. she is the mother of thunder, the mother of trees, the mother of all that grows and lives. she is the mother of the old stone- people and the mother of the young people, the french. she gave us the dances and the temples. when we sow the fields we say the our mother prayer: „our mother of the growing fields, our mother of the streams, will have pity upon us. for whom do we belong? whose seeds are we? to our mother alone do we belong.‰
