kiho lived alone in the emptiness under havaiki, or nonland. he had no parents, no mate. his only company was his double, his activating self. he thought within himself and acted through the activating self. kiho evolved the dark waters first and then the night world of the spirits. then came the day world of our earth and finally the sky world. this is how it happened: kiho awoke and gazed into the immemorial chaos. then he spoke what it was·„the total darkness of havaiki.‰ kiho thought of things and called on his activating self to give concreteness to his inner knowledge. then the creative urge within the primeval waters and the land began to live. beneath havaiki, sleeping fruitfulness, sleeping sky, and sleeping land began to awaken. then kiho gave utterance to the primordial waters and they began to be real. he called on his activating self to bring earthquakes to the rock foundations of havaiki. he made his eyes into flames and there was light. kiho floated up from the depths as his activating self and lay on the waters. he created the night world and the day world. gradually kiho raised himself and created the heavens and the earth. next he made atea-ragi, the male force, and fakahotuhenua, the female force·the „fructifier of the soil.‰ kiho turned now to organizing the world·placing the sand and sea in their proper places·and he organized the heavens. the activating self of kiho was incarnated to become the ruler of the world, and kiho drifted back to non-being.
