first god created tortoises, humans, and stones. he made males and females of each of these, but they could not reproduce. when they got old they just became young again. the creatures wanted children, however. first the tortoises asked for children. god told them that with children would also come death, but the tortoises insisted. they had children, and then death began for them. the humans made the same demand. finally god gave in, and children and death came to them as well. the stones learned from what they saw happening to the others, so they did not ask god for children, and they received neither children nor death.
