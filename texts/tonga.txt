in the time of darkness at the beginning, the gods vatea and tonga-iti fought over a child. each said the child belonged to him. finally they agreed to cut the child in two. vatea took the top half, squeezed it into a ball, and threw it into the sky, where it became the sun. tonga-iti did the same with his half, but only after it had spent some days on the ground, bleeding. his half, therefore, became the somewhat pale and drained moon.
