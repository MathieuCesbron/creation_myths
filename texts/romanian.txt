god made heaven and then, after measuring the space underneath with a ball of thread, he began to form the earth. a mole asked to help, and god gave him the thread to hold while he wove the patterns of the earth. sometimes the mole would let out too much thread, and finally the earth grew too large for the space under heaven. the mole was so upset that he hid under the earth. god sent the bee to look for him; he wanted the moleês advice on what to do about the mistake. the bee found the mole but the mole just laughed at the idea of advising god. the bee, however, hid in a flower and overheard the mole mumbling about what he would do if he were god. „i would squeeze the earth,‰ he said. „that would make mountains and valleys and make it smaller at the same time.‰ when the bee heard this, he went directly to god and told him. god did what the mole had said, and everything fit fine.
