in the beginning there was nothing. puana, the water serpent, came and cre- ated the world ex nihilo. his brother it- ciai, the jaguar, created water. it was their sister, kuma, who made the yaruro peo- ple. these people became members of the water serpent clan or the jaguar clan. it was only later that other people were created, people like the white raciona- les. the yaruros were given horses, but they were frightened by their size and gave them to the racionales, who still ride them today while the yaruros walk or canoe. at night the sun, who travels by canoe across the sky, goes to visit his wife, kuma. the stars are their children. the sunÃªs sister, the moon, travels in a larger boat. kuma gave the yaruros good plants, but they cut them from the top so the seeds fell onto the neighboring land of the racionales. now the yaruros have simple fruits while their neighbors have better things, like maize, tobacco, plan- tains, and bananas.
