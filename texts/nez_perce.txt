some nez perce, like some of their salishan neighbors, say this about the worldês creation. the sky chief made the earth out of a lump of clay, and he rolled it out like a piece of dough until it was the size it is now. he covered the earth with soil and made the heavens and the underworld as well. he connected them all with the world tree, an axis mundi. he made animals and a man·a wolf-man. he then made a woman from the manês tail. these were the indian ancestors.
