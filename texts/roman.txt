in the beginning was the formless and random mass we call chaos. there was no sun, there were no stars, there was nothing of permanent shape, and everything got in the way of everything else. at some point, a profound natural force, a god, separated earth from heaven, and earth from the waters, and developed harmony (cosmos) out of chaos. ether went up to the highest place; then came air, and finally heavy earth, which attracted all the gross elements of creation, sank to the bottom, and was held in place by the surrounding seas. earth itself was shaped into a great ball and arranged into the areas of the world. when everything was ready, the creator, or some say prometheus, decided to make humankind to watch over creation. the first man was made out of rainwater and some of the higher heavenly elements still found on earth; he was made in the creatorÃªs image. at first there was the golden age, when everything was perfect in heaven and on earth. humans ate freely of the abundant fruits of the earth. later there were struggles in heaven, and jove (jupiter) replaced saturn as the king there. the seasons developed on earth, and a bit of hardship. agriculture was practiced. this was the silver age. then came the bronze age, during which humans were good still, but turned to the arts of war. the last age was the iron age, in which goodness was overwhelmed by evil. there was war, greed, hardship, and disloyalty. no one could be trusted, and love died among humans. there were also wars in heaven during this time, between the forces of olympus and those of the ancient giants. after settling the affairs of heaven, the gods decided to destroy humanity on earth. this they did with a great flood. only a guiltless couple, deucalion and pyrrah, were saved in a boat so they could be the parents of a new human creation.
