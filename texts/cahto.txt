thunder and his companion, nagai- tcho, created the world from chaos. they began by repairing the old sandstone sky and stretching it with rocks that formed the four directions, also making a clear path for the sun. they made clouds by making fires on hills and mist by mak- ing fires in valleys. then thunder made a human. he took some earth and made the arms and legs, and he used some wad- ded up grass for the belly and heart. he used clay for the liver and kidneys and a reed for the trachea. for blood he used ochre and water. finally, thunder made the manês genitals and his eyes, nose, and mouth. out of one of the manês legs he made a woman. now thunder made it rain and he broke open rocks and trees with his power. there was a flood, and many people and animals died. the water animals·the whale, sea lion and others·were saved, however. thunder placed redwoods along the new shores and mountains, as well as in other places where there was fresh water for the peo- ple and animals to drink. he made many animals·good and bad·the bears, rattlesnakes, deer, and so forth. thun- der took his dog and wandered up and down the coast admiring his good, green, well-stocked earth. then he went back north to his home, fully satisfied with his work.
