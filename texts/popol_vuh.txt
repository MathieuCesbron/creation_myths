this is the account of how all was in suspense all calm in silence all motionless still and the expanse of the sky was empty this is the first account the first narrative there was neither man nor animal birds fishes crabs trees stones caves ravines grasses nor forests there was only the sky the surface of the earth had not appeared there was only the calm sea and the great expanse of the sky there was nothing brought together nothing which could make a noise nor anything which might move or tremble or could make noise in the sky there was nothing standing only the calm water the placid sea alone and tranquil nothing existed there was only immobility and silence in the darkness in the night only the creator the maker tepeu gucumatz the forefathers were in the water surrounded with light they were hidden under green and blue feathers and were therefore called gucumatz by nature they were great sages and great thinkers in this manner the sky existed and also the heart of heaven which is the name of god and thus he is called then came the word tepeu and gucumatz came together in the darkness in the night and tepeu and gucumatz talked together they talked then discussing and deliberating they agreed they united their words and their thoughts then while they meditated it became clear to them that when dawn would break man must appear then they planned the creation and the growth of the trees and the thickets and the birth of life and the creation of man thus it was arranged in the darkness and in the night by the heart of heaven who is called huracán the first is called caculhá huracán the second is chipicaculhá the third is raxacaculhá and these three are the heart of heaven then tepeu and gucumatz came together then they conferred about life and light what they would do so that there would be light and dawn who it would be who would provide food and sustenance thus let it be done let the emptiness be filled let the water recede and make a void let the earth appear and become solid let it be done thus they spoke let there be light let there be dawn in the sky and on the earth there shall be neither glory nor grandeur in our creation and formation until the human being is made man is formed so they spoke then the earth was created by them so it was in truth that they created the earth earth they said and instantly it was made like the mist like a cloud and like a cloud of dust was the creation when the mountains appeared from the water and instantly the mountains grew only by a miracle only by magic art were the mountains and valleys formed and instantly the groves of cypresses and pines put forth shoots together on the surface of the earth and thus gucumatz was filled with joy and exclaimed your coming has been fruitful heart of heaven and you huracán and you chipicaculhá raxacaculhá our work our creation shall be finished they answered first the earth was formed the mountains and the valleys the currents of water were divided the rivulets were running freely between the hills and the water was separated when the high mountains appeared thus was the earth created when it was formed by the heart of heaven the heart of earth as they are called who first made it fruitful when the sky was in suspense and the earth was submerged in the water so it was that they made perfect the work when they did it after thinking and meditating upon it then they made the small wild animals the guardians of the woods the spirits of the mountains the deer the birds pumas jaguars serpents snakes vipers guardians of the thickets and the forefathers asked shall there be only silence and calm under the trees under the vines it is well that hereafter there be someone to guard them so they said when they meditated and talked promptly the deer and the birds were created immediately they gave homes to the deer and the birds you deer shall sleep in the fields by the river bank and in the ravines here you shall be amongst the thicket amongst the pasture in the woods you shall multiply you shall walk on four feet and they will support you thus be it done so it was they spoke then they also assigned homes to the birds big and small you shall live in the trees and in the vines there you shall make your nests there you shall multiply there you shall increase in the branches of the trees and in the vines thus the deer and the birds were told they did their duty at once and all sought their homes and their nests and the creation of all the fourfooted animals and the birds being finished they were told by the creator and the maker and the forefathers speak cry warble call speak each one according to your variety each according to your kind so was it said to the deer the birds pumas jaguars and serpents speak then our names praise us your mother your father invoke then huracán chipicaculhá raxacaculhá the heart of heaven the heart of earth the creator the maker the forefathers speak invoke us adore us they were told but they could not make them speak like men they only hissed and screamed and cackled they were unable to make words and each screamed in a different way when the creator and the maker saw that it was impossible for them to talk to each other they said it is impossible for them to say our names the names of us their creators and makers this is not well said the forefathers to each other then they said to them because it has not been possible for you to talk you shall be changed we have changed our minds your food your pasture your homes and your nests you shall have they shall be the ravines and the woods because it has not been possible for you to adore us or invoke us there shall be those who adore us we shall make other beings who shall be obedient accept your destiny your flesh shall be tom to pieces so shall it be this shall be your lot so they said when they made known their will to the large and small animals which are on the face of the earth they wished to give them another trial they wished to make another attempt they wished to make all living things adore them but they could not understand each others speech they could succeed in nothing and could do nothing for this reason they were sacrificed and the animals which were on earth were condemned to be killed and eaten for this reason another attempt had to be made to create and make men by the creator the maker and the forefathers let us try again already dawn draws near let us make him who shall nourish and sustain us what shall we do to be invoked in order to be remembered on earth we have already tried with our first creations our first creatures but we could not make them praise and venerate us so then let us try to make obedient respectful beings who will nourish and sustain us thus they spoke then was the creation and the formation of earth of mud they made mans flesh but they saw that it was not good it melted away it was soft did not move had no strength it fell down it was limp it could not move its head its face fell to one side its sight was blurred it could not look behind at first it spoke but had no mind quickly it soaked in the water and could not stand and the creator and the maker said let us try again because our creatures will not be able to walk nor multiply let us consider this they said then they broke up and destroyed their work and their creation and they said what shall we do to perfect it in order that our worshipers our invokers will be successful thus they spoke when they conferred again let us say again to xpiyacoc xmucané hunahpúvuch hunahpúutiú cast your lot again try to create again in this manner the creator and the maker spoke to xpiyacoc and xmucané then they spoke to those soothsayers the grandmother of the day the grandmother of the dawn as they were called by the creator and the maker and whose names were xpiyacoc and xmucané and said huracán tepeu and gucumatz when they spoke to the soothsayer to the maker who are the diviners you must work together and find the means so that man whom we shall make man whom we are going to make will nourish and sustain us invoke and remember us enter then into council grandmother grandfather our grandmother our grandfather xpiyacoc xmucané make light make dawn have us invoked have us adored have us remembered by created man by made man by mortal man thus be it done let your nature be known hunahpúvuch hunahpúutiú twicemother twicefather nimac nimatziís the master of emeralds the worker in jewels the sculptor the carver the maker of beautiful plates the maker of green gourds the master of resin the master toltecat grandmother of the sun grandmother of dawn as you will be called by our works and our creatures cast the lot with your grains of corn and tzité do it thus and we shall know if we are to make or carve his mouth and eyes out of wood thus the diviners were told they went down at once to make their divination and cast their lots with the corn and the tzité fate creature said an old woman and an old man and this old man was the one who cast the lots with tzité the one called xpiyacoc and the old woman was the diviner the maker called chiracán xmucané beginning the divination they said get together grasp each other speak that we may hear they said say if it is well that the wood be got together and that it be carved by the creator and the maker and if this man of wood is he who must nourish and sustain us when there is light when it is day thou corn thou tzité thou fate thou creature get together take each other they said to the corn to the tzité to fate to the creature come to sacrifice here heart of heaven do not punish tepeu and gucumatz then they talked and spoke the truth your figures of wood shall come out well they shall speak and talk on earth so may it be they answered when they spoke and instantly the figures were made of wood they looked like men talked like men and populated the surface of the earth they existed and multiplied they had daughters they had sons these wooden figures but they did not have souls nor minds they did not remember their creator their maker they walked on all fours aimlessly they no longer remembered the heart of heaven and therefore they fell out of favor it was merely a trial an attempt at man at first they spoke but their face was without expression their feet and hands had no strength they had no blood nor substance nor moisture nor flesh their cheeks were dry their feet and hands were dry and their flesh was yellow therefore they no longer thought of their creator nor their maker nor of those who made them and cared for them these were the first men who existed in great numbers on the face of the earth immediately the wooden figures were annihilated destroyed broken up and killed a flood was brought about by the heart of heaven a great flood was formed which fell on the heads of the wooden creatures of tzité the flesh of man was made but when woman was fashioned by the creator and the maker her flesh was made of rushes these were the materials the creator and the maker wanted to use in making them but those that they had made that they had created did not think did not speak with their creator their maker and for this reason they were killed they were deluged a heavy resin fell from the sky the one called xecotcovach came and gouged out their eyes camalotz came and cut off their heads cotzbalam came and devoured their flesh tucumbalam came too and broke and mangled their bones and their nerves and ground and crumbled their bones this was to punish them because they had not thought of their mother nor their father the heart of heaven called huracán and for this reason the face of the earth was darkened and a black rain began to fall by day and by night then came the small animals and the large animals and sticks and stones struck their faces and all began to speak their earthen jars their griddles their plates their pots their grinding stones all rose up and struck their faces you have done us much harm you ate us and now we shall kill you said their dogs and birds of the barnyard and the grinding stones said we were tormented by you every day every day at night at dawn all the time our faces went holi holi huqui huqui because of you this was the tribute we paid you but now that you are no longer men you shall feel our strength we shall grind and tear your flesh to pieces said their grinding stones and then their dogs spoke and said why did you give us nothing to eat you scarcely looked at us but you chased us and threw us out you always had a stick ready to strike us while you were eating thus it was that you treated us you did not speak to us perhaps we shall not kill you now but why did you not look ahead why did you not think about yourselves now we shall destroy you now you shall feel the teeth of our mouths we shall devour you said the dogs and then they destroyed their faces and at the same time their griddles and pots spoke pain and suffering you have caused us our mouths and our faces were blackened with soot we were always put on the fire and you burned us as though we felt no pain now you shall feel it we shall burn you said their pots and they all destroyed their the wooden mens faces the stones of the hearth which were heaped together hurled themselves straight from the fire against their heads causing them pain the desperate ones the men of wood ran as quickly as they could they wanted to climb to the tops of the houses and the houses fell down and threw them to the ground they wanted to climb to the treetops and the trees cast them far away they wanted to enter the caverns and the caverns repelled them so was the ruin of the men who had been created and formed the men made to be destroyed and annihilated the mouths and faces of all of them were mangled and it is said that their descendants are the monkeys which now live in the forests these are all that remain of them because their flesh was made only of wood by the creator and the maker and therefore the monkey looks like man and is an example of a generation of men which were created and made but were only wooden figures it was cloudy and twilight then on the face of the earth there was no sun yet nevertheless there was a being called vucubcaquix who was very proud of himself the sky and the earth existed but the faces of the sun and the moon were covered and he vucubcaquix said truly they are clear examples of those people who were drowned and their nature is that of supernatural beings i shall now be great above all the beings created and formed i am the sun the light the moon he exclaimed great is my splendor because of me men shall walk and conquer for my eyes are of silver bright resplendent as precious stones as emeralds my teeth shine like perfect stones like the face of the sky my nose shines afar like the moon my throne is of silver and the face of the earth is lighted when i pass before my throne so then i am the sun i am the moon for all mankind so shall it be because i can see very far so vucubcaquix spoke but he was not really the sun he was only vainglorious of his feathers and his riches and he could see only as far as the horizon and he could not see over all the world the face of the sun had not yet appeared nor that of the moon nor the stars and it had not dawned therefore vucubcaquix became as vain as though he were the sun and the moon because the light of the sun and the moon had not yet shown itself his only ambition was to exalt himself and to dominate and all this happened when the flood came because of the woodenpeople now we shall tell how vucubcaquix was overthrown and died and how man was made by the creator and the maker this is the beginning of the defeat and the ruin of the glory of vucubcaquix brought about by two youths the first of whom was called hunahpú and the second xbalanqué they were really gods when they saw the harm which the arrogant one had done and wished to do in the presence of the heart of heaven the youths said it is not good that it be so when man does not yet live here on earth therefore we shall try to shoot him with our blowgun when he is eating we shall shoot him and make him sicken and then that will be the end of his riches his green stones his precious metals his emeralds his jewels of which he is so proud and this shall be the lot of all men for they must not become vain because of power and riches thus shall it be said the youths each one putting his blowgun to his shoulder well now vucubcaquix had two sons the first was called zipacná the second was cabracán and the mother of the two was called chimalmat the wife of vucubcaquix well zipacná played ball with the large mountains with chigag hunahpú pecul yaxcanul macamob and huliznab these are the names of the mountains which existed when it dawned and which were created in a single night by zipacná in this way then cabracán moved the mountains and made the large and small mountains tremble and in this way the sons of vucubcaquix proclaimed their pride listen i am the sun said vucubcaquix i am he who made the earth said zipacná i am he who shook the sky and made the earth tremble said cabracán in this way the sons of vucubcaquix followed the example of their fathers assumed greatness and this seemed very evil to the youths neither our first mother nor our first father had yet been created therefore the deaths of vucubcaquix and his sons and their destruction was decided upon by the youths now we shall tell how the two youths shot their blowguns at vucubcaquix and how each one of those who had become arrogant was destroyed vucubcaquix had a large nantze tree and he ate the fruit of it each day he went to the tree and climbed to the top hunahpú and xbalanqué had seen that this fruit was his food and they lay in ambush at the foot of the tree hidden among the leaves vucubcaquix came straight to his meal of nantzes instantly he was injured by a discharge from hunhunahpús blowgun which struck him squarely in the jaw and screaming he fell straight to earth from the treetop hunhunahpú ran quickly to overpower him but vucubcaquix seized his arm and wrenching it from him bent it back to the shoulder in this way vucubcaquix tore out hunhunahpús arm surely the two youths did well in not letting themselves be defeated first by vucubcaquix carrying hunhunahpús arm vucubcaquix went home and arrived there nursing his jaw what has happened to you my lord said chimalmat his wife what could it be but those two demons who shot me with blowguns and dislocated my jaw for that reason my teeth are loose and pain me very much but i have brought it his arm to put it on the fire let it hang there over the fire for surely these demons will come looking for it so said vucubcaquix as he hung up the arm of hunhunahpú having thought it over hunhunahpú and xbalanqué went to talk with an old man who had snowwhite hair and with an old woman really very old and humble both already bent like very old people the old man was called zaquinimac and the old woman zaquinimatziís the youths said to the old woman and the old man come with us to vucubcaquixs house to get our arm we will follow you and you shall tell them these with us are our grandchildren their mother and father are dead so they follow us everywhere we are given alms for the only thing that we know how to do is take the worm from the teeth so vucubcaquix shall think we are boys and we shall also be there to advise you said the two youths very well answered the old man and woman then they started out for the place where they found vucubcaquix reclining on his throne the old woman and man walked along followed by the two boys who stayed behind them in this way they arrived at the house of the lord who was screaming because his tooth pained him when vucubcaquix saw the old man and the old woman and those who accompanied them he asked where do you come from grandparents we come looking for something to eat honorable sir they answered and what do you eat are those not your sons who are with you oh no sir they are our grandsons but we are sorry for them and what is given to us we share with them sir answered the old woman and the old man meanwhile the lord was suffering terrible pain from his tooth and it was only with great difficulty that he could speak i earnestly beseech you to have pity on me what can you do what do you know how to cure the lord asked them and the old ones answered oh sir we only take the worm from the teeth cure the eyes and set bones very well cure my teeth which are really making me suffer day and night and because of them and of my eyes i cannot be calm and cannot sleep all of this is because two demons shot me with a pellet from their blowgun and for that reason i cannot eat have pity on me then tighten my teeth with your hands very well sir it is a worm which makes you suffer it will end when these teeth are pulled and others put in their place it is not well that you pull my teeth because it is only with them that i am a lord and all my ornaments are my teeth and my eyes we will put others of ground bone in their place but the ground bone was nothing but grains of white corn very well pull them out come and relieve me he replied then they pulled vucubcaquixs teeth but in their place they put only grains of white corn and these grains of corn shone in his mouth instantly his features sagged and he no longer looked like a lord they removed the rest of his teeth which shone like pearls in his mouth and finally they cured vucubcaquixs eyes piercing the pupils of his eyes and they took all his riches but he felt nothing any more he only watched because at the advice of hunahpú and xbalanqué they took from him all of the things of which he had been so proud then vucubcaquix died hunhunahpú recovered his arm chimalmat the wife of vucubcaquix also perished in this way vucubcaquix lost his riches the healer took all the emeralds and precious stones which had been his pride here on earth the old woman and the old man who did this were miraculous beings and having recovered the arm of hunhunahpú they put it in place and it was all right again it was only to bring about the death of vucubcaquix that they did this because it seemed wicked to them that he should become so arrogant and then the two youths went on having in this way carried out the order of the heart of heaven here now are the deeds of zipacná the elder son of vucubcaquix i am the creator of the mountains said zipacná zipacná was bathing at the edge of a river when four hundred youths passed dragging a log to support their house the four hundred were walking after having cut down a large tree to make the ridgepole of their house then zipacná came up and going toward the four hundred youths said to them what are you doing boys it is only this log they answered which we cannot lift and carry on our shoulders i will carry it where does it have to go what do you want it for for a ridgepole for our house all right he answered and lifting it up he put it on his shoulders and carried it to the entrance of the house of the four hundred boys now stay with us boy they said have you a mother or father i have neither he answered then we shall hire you tomorrow to prepare another log to support our house good he answered the four hundred boys talked together then and said how shall we kill this boy because it is not good what he has done lifting the log alone let us make a big hole and push him so that he will fall into it go down and take out the earth and carry it from the pit we shall tell him and when he stoops down to go down into the pit we shall let the large log fall on him and he will die there in the pit so said the four hundred boys and then they dug a large very deep pit then they called zipacná we like you very much go go and dig dirt for we cannot reach the bottom of the pit they said all right he answered he went at once into the pit and calling to him as he was digging the dirt they said have you gone down very deep yet yes he answered beginning to dig the pit but the pit which he was making was to save him from danger he knew that they wanted to kill him so when he dug the pit he made a second hole at one side in order to free himself how far have you gone the four hundred boys called down i am still digging i will call up to you when i have finished the digging said zipacná from the bottom of the pit but he was not digging his grave instead he was opening another pit in order to save himself at last zipacná called to them but when he called he was already safe in the second pit come and take out and carry away the dirt which i have dug and which is in the bottom of the pit he said because in truth i have made it very deep do you not hear my call nevertheless your calls your words repeat themselves like an echo once twice and so i hear well where you are so zipacná called from the pit where he was hidden shouting from the depths then the boys hurled the great log violently and it fell quickly with a thud to the bottom of the pit let no one speak let us wait until we hear his dying screams they said to each other whispering and each one covered his face as the log fell noisily he zipacná spoke then crying out but he called only once when the log fell to the bottom how well we have succeeded in this now he is dead said the boys if unfortunately he had continued what he had begun to do we would have been lost because he already had interfered with us the four hundred boys and filled with joy they said now we must make our chicha within the next three days when the three days are passed we shall drink to the construction of our new house we the four hundred boys then they said tomorrow we shall look and day after tomorrow we shall also look to see if the ants do not come out of the earth when the body smells and begins to rot presently we shall become calm and drink our chicha they said but from his pit zipacná listened to everything the boys said and later on the second day multitudes of ants came going and coming and gathering under the log some carried zipacnás hair in their mouths and others carried his fingernails when the boys saw this they said that devil has now perished look how the ants have gathered how they have come by hordes some bringing his hair and others his fingernails look what we have done so they spoke to each other nevertheless zipacná was very much alive he had cut his hair and gnawed off his fingernails to give them to the ants and so the four hundred boys believed that he was dead and on the third day they began the orgy and all of the boys got drunk and the four hundred being drunk knew nothing any more and then zipacná let the house fall on their heads and killed all of them not even one or two among the four hundred were saved they were killed by zipacná son of vucubcaquix in this way the four hundred boys died and it is said that they became the group of stars which because of them are called motz but it may not be true now we shall tell how zipacná was defeated by the two boys hunahpú and xbalanqué now follows the defeat and death of zipacná when he was overcome by the two boys hunahpú and xbalanqué the boys hearts were full of rancor because the four hundred young men had been killed by zipacná and he only hunted fish and crabs at the bank of the river which were his daily food during the day he went about looking for food and at night he carried mountains on his back with a leaf of the ec plant which is found in the forest hunahpú and xbalanqué quickly made a figure to look like a very large crab with this they made the stomach of the crab the claws they made of pahac and for the shell which covers the back they used a stone then they put the crab at the bottom of a cave at the foot of a large mountain called meaguán where he was overcome then the boys went to find zipacná on the river bank where are you going young man they asked him i am not going anywhere zipacná answered only looking for food boys and what is your food fish and crabs but there are none here and i have not found any i have not eaten since day before yesterday and i am dying of hunger said zipacná to hunahpú and xbalanqué over there in the bottom of the ravine there is a crab a really large crab and it would be well if you would eat it only it bit us when we tried to catch it and so we were afraid we wouldnt try to catch it for anything said hunahpú and xbalanqué have pity on me come and show it to me boys begged zipacná we do not want to you go alone you will not get lost follow the bank of the river and you will come out at the foot of a large hill there it is making a noise at the bottom of the ravine you have only to go there said hunahpú and xbalanqué oh unfortunate me wont you accompany me boys come and show it to me there are many birds which you can shoot with your blowguns and i know where to find them said zipacná his meekness convinced the boys and they asked him but can you really catch him because it is only for you that we are returning we are not going to try to get it again because it bit us when we were crawling into the cave after that we were afraid to crawl in but we almost caught it so then it is best that you crawl in they said very well said zipacná and then they went with him they arrived at the bottom of the ravine and there stretched on his back was the crab showing his red shell and there also in the bottom of the ravine was the boys hoax good good said zipacná happily i should like to have it in my mouth already and he was really dying of hunger he wanted to try to crawl in he wanted to enter but the crab was climbing he came out at once and the boys asked did you not get it no he answered because he was going up and i almost caught him but perhaps it would be good if i go in from above he added and then he entered again from above but as he was almost inside with only the soles of his feet showing the great hill slid and fell slowly down on his chest zipacná never returned and he was changed into stone in this way zipacná was defeated by the two boys hunahpú and xbalanqué he was the elder son of vucubcaquix and he according to the ancient legend was the one who made the mountains at the foot of the hill called meaguán he was vanquished only by a miracle was he vanquished the second of the arrogant ones one was left whose history we shall tell now the third of the arrogant ones was the second son of vucubcaquix who was called cabracán i demolish the mountains he said but hunahpú and xbalanqué also defeated cabracán huracán chipicaculhá and raxacaculhá talked and said to hunahpú and xbalanqué let the second son of vucubcaquix also be defeated this is our will for it is not well what they do on earth exalting their glory their grandeur and their power and it must not be so lure him to where the sun rises said huracán to the two youths very well honored sir they answered because what we see is not right do you not exist you who are the peace you heart of heaven said the boys as they listened to the command of huracán meanwhile cabracán was busy shaking the mountains at the gentlest tap of his feet on the earth the large and small mountains opened thus the boys found him and asked cabracán where are you going young man nowhere he answered here i am moving the mountains and i am leveling them to the ground forever he answered then cabracán asked hunahpú and xbalanqué what did you come to do here i do not recognize you what are your names said cabracán we have no names they answered we are nothing more than shooters of blowguns and hunters with birdtraps on the mountains we are poor and we have nothing young man we only walk over the large and small mountains young man and we have just seen a large mountain over there where you see the pink sky it really rises up very high and overlooks the tops of all the hills so it is that we have not been able to catch even one or two of the birds on it boy but is it true that you can level all the mountains hunahpú and xbalanqué asked cabracán have you really seen the mountain of which you speak where is it if i see it i shall demolish it where did you see it over there it is where the sun rises said hunahpú and xbalanqué very well show me the road he said to the two boys oh no they answered we must take you between us one shall go at your left and the other at your right because we have our blowguns and if there should be birds we can shoot them and so they set out happily trying out their blowguns but when they shot with them they did not use the clay pellets in the tube of the blowgun instead they felled the birds only with the puff of air when they shot them which surprised cabracán very much then the boys built a fire and put the birds on it to roast but they rubbed one of the birds with chalk covering it with a white earth soil we shall give him this they said to whet his appetite with the odor which it gives off this bird of ours shall be his ruin as we cover this bird with earth so we shall bring him down to the earth and bury him in the earth great shall be the wisdom of a created being of a being fashioned when it dawns when there is light said the boys as it is natural for man to wish to eat so cabracán desires food said hunahpú and xbalanqué to each other meanwhile the birds were roasting they were beginning to turn golden brown and the fat and juice which dripped from them made an appetizing odor cabracán wanted very much to eat them they made his mouth water he yawned and the saliva and spittle drooled because of the smell which the birds gave off then he asked them what is that you eat the smell is really savoury give me a little piece he said to them then they gave a bird to cabracán the one which would be his ruin and when he had finished eating it they set out toward the east where the great mountain was but already cabracáns legs and hands were weakening and he had no strength because of the earth with which the bird he had eaten was rubbed and he could do nothing to the mountains neither was it possible to level them then the boys tied him they tied his hands behind him and also tied his neck and his feet together then they threw him to the ground and there they buried him in this way cabracán was overcome by hunahpú and xbalanqué it would be impossible to tell of all the things they did here on earth now we shall tell of the birth of hunahpú and xbalanqué having first told of the destruction of vucubcaquix and that of zipacná and of cabracán here on earth now we shall also tell the name of the father of hunahpú and xbalanqué we shall not tell his origin and we shall not tell the history of the birth of hunahpú and xbalanqué we shall tell only half of it only a part of the history of his father here is the story here are the names of hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú as they are called their parents were xpiyacoc and xmucané during the night hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú were born of xpiyacoc and xmucané well now hunhunahpú had begotten two sons the first was called hunbatz and the second hunchouén the mother of the two sons was called xbaquiyalo thus was the wife of hunhunahpú called as for the other son vucubhunahpú he had no wife he was single by nature these two sons were very wise and great was their wisdom on earth they were soothsayers of good disposition and good habits all the arts were taught to hunbatz and hunchouén the sons of hunhunahpú they were flautists singers shooters with blowguns painters sculptors jewelers silversmiths these were hunbatz and hunchouén well hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú did nothing but play dice and ball a day long and when the four got together to play ball one pair played against the other pair and voc the messenger of huracán of chipicaculhá of raxacaculhá came there to watch them but voc did not stay far from the earth nor far from xibalba and in an instant he went up to heaven to the side of huracán they were still here on earth when the mother of hunbatz and hunchouén died and having gone to play ball on the road to xibalba they were overheard by huncamé and vucubcamé the lords of xibalba what are they doing on earth who are they who are making the earth shake and making so much noise go and call them let them come here to play ball here we will overpower them we are no longer respected by them they no longer have consideration or fear of our rank and they even fight above our heads said all the lords of xibalba all of them held a council those called huncamé and vucubcamé were the supreme judges all the lords had been assigned their duties each one was given his own authority by huncamé and vucubcamé they were then xiquiripat and cuchumaquic lords of these names they were the two who caused the shedding of blood of the men others were called ahalpuh and ahalganá also lords and their work was to make men swell and make pus gush forth from their legs and stain their faces yellow what is called chuganal such was the work of ahalpuh and ahalganá others were lord chamiabac and lord chamiaholom constables of xibalba whose staffs were of bone their work was to make men waste away until they were nothing but skin and bone and they died and they carried them with their stomach and bones stretched out this was the work of chamiabac and chamiaholom as they were called others were called lord ahalmez and lord ahaltocob their work was to bring disaster upon men as they were going home or in front of it and they would be found wounded stretched out face up on the ground dead this was the work of ahalmez and ahaltocob as they were called immediately after them were other lords named xic and patán whose work it was to cause men to die on the road which is called sudden death making blood to rush to their mouths until they died vomiting blood the work of each one of these lords was to seize upon them squeeze their throats and chests so that the men died on the road making the blood rush to their throats when they were walking this was the work of xic and patán and having gathered in council they discussed how to torment and wound hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú what the lords of xibalba coveted were the playing implements of hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpútheir leather pads and rings and gloves and crown and masks which were the playing gear of hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú now we shall tell of their journey to xibalba and how they left behind them the sons of hunhunahpú hunbatz and hun chouén whose mother had died then we shall tell how hunbatz and hunchouén were overcome by hunahpú and xbalanqué the messengers of huncamé and vucubcamé arrived immediately go ahpop achih they were told go and call hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú say to them come with us the lords say that you must come they must come here to play ball with us so that they shall make us happy for really they amaze us so then they must come said the lords and have them bring their playing gear their rings their gloves and have them bring their rubber balls too said the lords tell them to come quickly they told the messengers and these messengers were owls chabitucur huracántucur caquixtucur and holomtucur these were the names of the messengers of xibalba chabitucur was swift as an arrow huracántucur had only one leg caquixtucur had a red back and holomtucur had only a head no legs but he had wings the four messengers had the rank of ahpopachih leaving xibalba they arrived quickly bringing their message to the court where hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú were playing ball at the ballcourt which was called nimxobcarchah the owl messengers went directly to the ballcourt and delivered their message exactly as it was given to them by huncamé vucubcamé ahalpuh ahalganá chamiabac chamiaholom xiquiripat cuchumaquic ahalmez ahaltocob xic and patán as the lords were called who sent the message by the owls did the lords huncamé and vucubcamé really say that we must go with you they certainly said so and let them bring all their playing gear the lords said very well said the youths wait for us we are only going to say goodbye to our mother and having gone straight home they said to their mother for their father was dead we are going our mother but our going is only for a while the messengers of the lord have come to take us they must come they said according to the messengers we shall leave our ball here in pledge they added they went immediately to hang it in the space under the rooftree we will return to play they said and going to hunbatz and hunchouén they said to them keep on playing the flute and singing painting and carving warm our house and warm the heart of your grandmother when they took leave of their mother xmucané was moved and burst into tears do not worry we are going but we have not died yet said hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú as they left hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú went immediately and the messengers took them on the road thus they were descending the road to xibalba by some very steep stairs they went down until they came to the bank of a river which flowed rapidly between the ravines called nuziván cul and cuziván and crossed it then they crossed the river which flows among thorny calabash trees there were very many calabash trees but they passed through them without hurting themselves then they came to the bank of a river of blood and crossed it without drinking its waters they only went to the river bank and so they were not overcome they went on until they came to where four roads joined and there at the crossroads they were overcome one of the four roads was red another black another white and another yellow and the black road said to them i am the one you must take because i am the way of the lord so said the road and from here on they were already overcome they were taken over the road to xibalba and when they arrived at the council room of the lords of xibalba they had already lost the match well the first ones who were seated there were only figures of wood arranged by the men of xibalba these they greeted first how are you huncamé they said to the wooden man how are you vucubcamé they said to the other wooden man but they did not answer instantly the lords of xibalba burst into laughter and all the other lords began to laugh loudly because they already took for granted the downfall and defeat of hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú and they continued to laugh then huncamé and vucubcamé spoke very well they said you have come tomorrow you shall prepare the mask your rings and your gloves they said come and sit down on our bench they said but the bench which they offered them was of hot stone and when they sat down they were burned they began to squirm around on the bench and if they had not stood up they would have burned their seats the lords of xibalba burst out laughing again they were dying of laughter they writhed from pain in their stomach in their blood and in their bones caused by their laughter all the lords of xibalba laughed go now to that house they said there you will get your sticks of fat pine and your cigar and there you shall sleep immediately they arrived at the house of gloom there was only darkness within the house meanwhile the lords of xibalba discussed what they should do let us sacrifice them tomorrow let them die quickly quickly so that we can have their playing gear to use in play said the lords of xibalba to each other well their fatpine sticks were round and were called zaquitoc which is the pine of xibalba their fatpine sticks were pointed and filed and were as bright as bone the pine of xibalba was very hard hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú entered the house of gloom there they were given their fatpine sticks a single lighted stick which huncamé and vucubcamé sent them together with a lighted cigar for each of them which the lords had sent they went to give them to hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú they found them crouching in the darkness when the porters arrived with the fatpine sticks and the cigars as they entered the pine sticks lighted the place brightly each of you light your pine sticks and your cigars come and bring them back at dawn you must not burn them up but you must return them whole this is what the lords told us to say so they said and so they were defeated they burned up the pine sticks and they also finished the cigars which had been given to them there were many punishments in xibalba the punishments were of many kinds the first was the house of gloom quequmaha in which there was only darkness the second was xuxulimha the house where everybody shivered in which it was very cold a cold unbearable wind blew within the third was the house of jaguars balamiha it was called in which there were nothing but jaguars which stalked about jumped around roared and made fun the jaguars were shut up in the house zotzihá the house of bats the fourth place of punishment was called within this house there were nothing but bats which squeaked and cried and flew around and around the bats were shut in and could not get out the fifth was called chayimhá the house of knives in which there were only sharp pointed knives silent or grating against each other in the house there were many places of torture in xibalba but hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú did not enter them we only mention the names of these houses of punishment when hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú came before huncamé and vucubcamé they said where are my cigars where are my sticks of fat pine which i gave you last night they are all gone sir well today shall be the end of your days now you shall die you shall be destroyed we will break you into pieces and here your faces will stay hidden you shall be sacrificed said huncamé and vucubcamé they sacrificed them immediately and buried them in the pucbalchah as it was called before burying them they cut off the head of hunhunahpú and buried the older brother together with the younger brother take the head and put it in that tree which is planted on the road said huncamé and vucubcamé and having put the head in the tree instantly the tree which had never borne fruit before the head of hunhunahpú was placed among its branches was covered with fruit and this calabash tree it is said is the one which we now call the head of hunhunahpú huncamé and vucubcamé looked in amazement at the fruit on the tree the round fruit was everywhere but they did not recognize the head of hunhunahpú it was exactly like the other fruit of the calabash tree so it seemed to all of the people of xibalba when they came to look at it according to their judgment the tree was miraculous because of what had instantly occurred when they put hunhunahpús head among its branches and the lords of xibalba said let no one come to pick this fruit let no one come and sit under this tree they said and so the lords of xibalba resolved to keep everybody away the head of hunhunahpú did not appear again because it had become one and the same as the fruit of the gourd tree nevertheless a girl heard the wonderful story now we shall tell about her arrival this is the story of a maiden the daughter of a lord named cuchumaquic a maiden then daughter of a lord heard this story the name of the father was cuchumaquic and that of the maiden was xquic when she heard the story of the fruit of the tree which her father told she was amazed to hear it why can i not go to see this tree which they tell about the girl exclaimed surely the fruit of which i hear tell must be very good finally she went alone and arrived at the foot of the tree which was planted in pucbalchah ah she exclaimed what fruit is this which this tree bears is it not wonderful to see how it is covered with fruit must i die shall i be lost if i pick one of this fruit said the maiden then the skull which was among the branches of the tree spoke up and said what is it you wish those round objects which cover the branches of the trees are nothing but skulls so spoke the head of hunhunahpú turning to the maiden do you perchance want them it added yes i want them the maiden answered very well said the skull stretch your right hand up here very well said the maiden and with her right hand reached toward the skull in that instant the skull let a few drops of spittle fall directly into the maidens palm she looked quickly and intently at the palm of her hand but the spittle of the skull was not there in my saliva and spittle i have given you my descendants said the voice in the tree now my head has nothing on it any more it is nothing but a skull without flesh so are the heads of the great princes the flesh is all which gives them a handsome appearance and when they die men are frightened by their bones so too is the nature of the sons which are like saliva and spittle they may be sons of a lord of a wise man or of an orator they do not lose their substance when they go but they bequeath it the image of the lord of the wise man or of the orator does not disappear nor is it lost but he leaves it to the daughters and to the sons which he begets i have done the same with you go up then to the surface of the earth that you may not die believe in my words that it will be so said the head of hunhunahpú and of vucubhunahpú and all that they did together was by order of huracán chipicaculhá and raxacaculhá after all of the above talking the maiden returned directly to her home having immediately conceived the sons in her belly by virtue of the spittle only and thus hunahpú and xbalanqué were begotten and so the girl returned home and after six months had passed her father who was called cuchumaquic noticed her condition at once the maidens secret was discovered by her father when he observed that she was pregnant then the lords huncamé and vucubcamé held council with cuchumaquic my daughter is pregnant sirs she has been disgraced exclaimed cuchumaquic when he appeared before the lords very well they said command her to tell the truth and if she refuses to speak punish her let her be taken far from here and sacrifice her very well honorable lords he answered then he questioned his daughter whose are the children that you carry my daughter and she answered i have no child my father for i have not yet known a youth very well he replied you are really a whore take her and sacrifice her ahpop achih bring me her heart in a gourd and return this very day before the lords he said to the two owls the four messengers took the gourd and set out carrying the young girl in their arms and also taking the knife of flint with which to sacrifice her and she said to them it cannot be that you will kill me oh messengers because what i bear in my belly is no disgrace but was begotten when i went to marvel at the head of hunhunahpú which was in pucbalchah so then you must not sacrifice me oh messengers said the young girl turning to them and what shall we put in place of your heart your father told us bring the heart return before the lords do your duty all working together bring it in the gourd quickly and put the heart in the bottom of the gourd perchance did he not speak to us so what shall we put in the gourd we wish too that you should not die said the messengers very well but my heart does not belong to them neither is your home here nor must you let them force you to kill men later in truth the real criminals will be at your mercy and i will overcome huncamé and vucubcamé so then the blood and only the blood shall be theirs and shall be given to them neither shall my heart be burned before them gather the product of this tree said the maiden the red sap gushing forth from the tree fell in the gourd and with it they made a ball which glistened and took the shape of a heart the tree gave forth sap similar to blood with the appearance of real blood then the blood or that is to say the sap of the red tree clotted and formed a very bright coating inside the gourd like clotted blood meanwhile the tree glowed at the work of the maiden it was called the red tree of cochineal but since then it has taken the name of blood tree because its sap is called blood there on earth you shall be beloved and you shall have all that belongs to you said the maiden to the owls very well girl we shall go there we go up to serve you you continue on your way while we go to present the sap instead of your heart to the lords said the messengers when they arrived in the presence of the lords all were waiting you have finished asked huncamé all is finished my lords here in the bottom of the gourd is the heart very well let us see exclaimed huncamé and grasping it with his fingers he raised it the shell broke and the blood flowed bright red in color stir up the fire and put it on the coals said huncamé as soon as they threw it on the fire the men of xibalba began to sniff and drawing near to it they found the fragrance of the heart very sweet and as they sat deep in thought the owls the maidens servants left and flew like a flock of birds from the abyss toward earth and the four became her servants in this manner the lords of xibalba were defeated all were tricked by the maiden well then hunbatz and hunchouén were with their mother when the woman called xquic arrived when the woman xquic came before the mother of hunbatz and hunchouén she carried her sons in her belly and it was not long before hunahpú and xbalanqué as they were called were to be born when the woman came to the old lady she said to her i have come mother i am your daughterinlaw and your daughter mother she said this when she entered the grandmothers house where did you come from where are my sons did they perchance not die in xibalba do you not see these two who remain their descendants and blood and are called hunbatz and hunchouén go from here get out the old lady screamed at the girl nevertheless it is true that i am your daughterinlaw i have been for a long time i belong to hunhunahpú they live in what i carry hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú are not dead they will return to show themselves clearly my motherinlaw and you shall soon see their image in what i bring to you she said to the old woman then hunbatz and hunchouén became angry they did nothing but play the flute and sing paint and sculpture all day long and were the consolation of the old woman then the old woman said i do not wish you to be my daughterinlaw because what you bear in your womb is fruit of your disgrace furthermore you are an impostor my sons of whom you speak are already dead presently the grandmother added this that i tell you is the truth but well it is all right you are my daughterinlaw according to what i have heard go then bring the food for those who must be fed go and gather a large net full of corn and return at once since you are my daughterinlaw according to what i hear she said to the girl very well the girl replied and she went at once to the cornfield which hunbatz and hunchouén had planted they had opened the road and the girl took it and so came to the cornfield but she found only one stalk of corn there were not two or three and when she saw that there was only one stalk with an ear on it the girl became very anxious ah sinner that i am unfortunate me where must i go to get a net full of corn as she told me to do she exclaimed immediately she began to beg chahal for the food which she had to get and must take back xtoh xcanil xcacau you who cook the corn and you chahal guardian of the food of hunbatz and hunchouén said the girl and then she seized the beards the red silk of the ears of corn and pulled them off without picking the ear then she arranged the silk in the net like ears of corn and the large net was completely filled the girl returned immediately the animals of the field went along carrying the net and when they arrived they went to put the load in a corner of the house as though she might have carried it the old woman came and when she saw the corn in the large net she exclaimed where have you brought all this corn from did you perchance take all the corn in our field and bring it all in i shall go at once to see said the old woman and she set out on the road to the cornfield but the one stalk of corn was still standing there and she saw too where the net had been at the foot of the stalk the old woman quickly returned to her house and said to the girl this is proof enough that you are really my daughterinlaw i shall now see your little ones those whom you carry and who also are to be soothsayers she said to the girl now we shall tell of the birth of hunahpú and xbalanqué here then we shall tell about their birth when the day of their birth arrived the girl named xquic gave birth but the grandmother did not see them when they were born instantly the two boys called hunahpú and xbalanqué were born there in the wood they were born then they came to the house but they could not sleep go throw them out said the old woman because truly they cry very much then they went and put them on an anthill there they slept peacefully then they took them from the anthill and laid them on thistles now what hunbatz and hunchouén wished was that they hunahpú and xbalanqué would die there on the anthill or on the thistles they wished this because of the hatred and envy hunbatz and hunchouén felt for them at first they refused to receive their younger brothers in the house they would not recognize them and so they were brought up in the fields hunbatz and hunchouén were great musicians and singers they had grown up in the midst of trials and want and they had had much trouble but they became very wise they were flautists singers painters and carvers all of this they knew how to do they had heard about their birth and knew also that they were the successors of their parents those who went to xibalba and died there hunbatz and hunchouén were diviners and in their hearts they knew everything concerning the birth of their two younger brothers nevertheless because they were envious they did not show their wisdom and their hearts were filled with bad will for them although hunahpú and xbalanqué had not offended them in any way these two last did nothing all day long but shoot their blowguns they were not loved by their grandmother nor by hunbatz nor by hunchouén they were given nothing to eat only when the meal was ended and hunbatz and hunchouén had already eaten then the younger brothers came to eat but they did not become angry nor did they become vexed but suffered silently because they knew their rank and they understood everything clearly they brought their birds when they came and hunbatz and hunchouén ate them without giving anything to either of the two hunahpú and xbalanqué the only thing that hunbatz and hunchouén did was to play the flute and sing and once when hunahpú and xbalanqué came without bringing any bird at all they went into the house and their grandmother became furious why did you bring no birds she said to hunahpú and xbalanqué and they answered what happened grandmother is that our birds were caught in the tree and we could not climb up to get them dear grandmother if our elder brothers so wish let them come with us to bring the birds down they said very well the older brothers answered we shall go with you at dawn the two younger brothers then discussed the way to overcome hunbatz and hunchouén we shall only change their nature their appearance and so let our word be fulfilled for all the suffering that they have caused us they wanted us to die that we might be lost we their younger brothers in their hearts they really believe that we have come to be their servants for these reasons we shall overcome them and teach them a lesson thus they spoke then they went toward the foot of the tree called canté they were accompanied by their two elder brothers and they were shooting their blowguns it was not possible to count the birds which sang in the tree and their elder brothers marveled to see so many birds there were birds but not one fell at the foot of the tree our birds do not fall to the ground go and fetch them down they said to their elder brothers very well the latter answered and then they climbed the tree but the tree became larger and the trunk swelled then hunbatz and hunchouén wanted to come down but they could not come down from the top of the tree then they called from the treetop what has happened to us our brothers unfortunate we this tree frightens us only to look at it oh our brothers they called from the treetop and hunahpú and xbalanqué answered loosen your breechclouts tie them below your stomach leaving the long ends hanging and pull these from behind and in this way you can walk easily thus said the younger brothers very well they answered pulling the ends of their belts back but instantly these were changed into tails and they took on the appearance of monkeys then they hopped over the branches of the trees among the great woods and little woods and they buried themselves in the forest making faces and swinging in the branches of the trees in this way hunbatz and hunchouén were overcome by hunahpú and xbalanqué and only because of their magic could they have done it then they returned to their home and when they arrived they spoke to their grandmother and their mother and said to them what could it be grandmother that has happened to our elder brothers that suddenly their faces turned into the faces of animals so they said if you have done any harm to your elder brothers you have hurt me and have filled me with sadness do not do such a thing to your brothers oh my children said the old woman to hunahpú and xbalanqué and they replied to their grandmother do not grieve our grandmother you shall see our brothers faces again they shall return but it will be a difficult trial for you grandmother be careful that you do not laugh at them and now let us cast our lot they said immediately they began to play their flutes playing the song of hunahpúqoy then they sang playing the flute and drum picking up their flutes and their drum afterward they sat down close to their grandmother and continued playing and calling back their brothers with music and song intoning the song called hunahpúqoy at last hunbatz and hunchouén came and began to dance but when the old woman saw their ugly faces she began to laugh unable to control her laughter and they went away at once and she did not see their faces again now you see grandmother they have gone to the forest what have you done grandmother of ours we may make this trial but four times and only three are left let us call them back again with flute and with song but you try to control your laughter let the trial begin said hunahpú and xbalanqué immediately they began again to play hunbatz and hunchouén returned dancing and came as far as the center of the court of the house grimacing and provoking their grandmother to laughter until finally she broke into loud laughter they were really very amusing with their monkey faces their broad bottoms their narrow tails and the hole of their stomach all of which made the old woman laugh again the elder brothers went back to the woods and hunahpú and xbalanqué said and now what shall we do grandmother we shall try once again this third time they played the flute again and the monkeys returned dancing the grandmother contained her laughter then they went up over the kitchen their eyes gave off a red light they drew away and scrubbed their noses and frightened each other with the faces they made and as the grandmother saw all of this she burst into violent laughter and they did not see the faces of the elder brothers again because of the old womans laughter only once more shall we call them grandmother so that they shall come for the fourth time said the boys they began again then to play the flute but their brothers did not return the fourth time instead they fled into the forest as quickly as they could the boys said to their grandmother we have done everything possible dear grandmother they came once then we tried to call them again but do not grieve here we are your grandchildren you must look to us oh our mother oh our grandmother to remind you of our elder brothers those who were called and have the names of hunbatz and hunchouén said hunahpú and xbalanqué they were invoked by the musicians and singers and by the old people the painters and craftsmen also invoked them in days gone by but they were changed into animals and became monkeys because they became arrogant and abused their brothers in this way they were disgraced this was their loss in this way hunbatz and hunchouén were overcome and became animals they had always lived in their home they were musicians and singers and also did great things when they lived with their grandmother and with their mother then they hunahpú and xbalanqué began to work in order to be well thought of by their grandmother and their mother the first thing they made was the cornfield we are going to plant the cornfield grandmother and mother they said do not grieve here we are your grandchildren we who shall take the place of our brothers said hunahpú and xbalanqué at once they took their axes their picks and their wooden hoes and went each carrying his blowgun on his shoulder as they left the house they asked their grandmother to bring them their midday meal at midday come and bring our food grandmother they said very well my grandsons the old woman replied soon they came to the field and as they plunged the pick into the earth it worked the earth it did the work alone in the same way they put the ax in the trunks of the trees and in the branches and instantly they fell and all the trees and vines were lying on the ground the trees fell quickly with only one stroke of the ax the pick also dug a great deal one could not count the thistles and brambles which had been felled with one blow of the pick neither was it possible to tell what it had dug and broken up in all the large and small woods and having taught an animal called xmucur they had it climb to the top of a large tree and hunahpú and xbalanqué said to it watch for our grandmother to come with our food and as soon as she comes begin at once to sing and we shall seize the pick and the ax very well xmucur answered and they began to shoot with their blowguns certainly they did none of the work of clearing and cultivating a little later the dove sang and they ran quickly grabbing the pick and ax and one of them covered his head and also deliberately covered his hands with earth and in the same way smeared his face to look like a real laborer and the other purposely threw splinters of wood over his head as though he really had been cutting the trees thus their grandmother saw them they ate at once but they had not really done the work of tilling the soil and without deserving it they were given their midday meal after a while they went home we are really tired grandmother they said upon arriving stretching their legs and arms before her but without reason they returned the following day and upon arriving at the field they found that all the trees and vines were standing again and that the brambles and thistles had become entangled again who has played this trick on us they said no doubt all the small and large animals did it the puma the jaguar the deer the rabbit the mountaincat the coyote the wild boar the coati the small birds the large birds they it was who did it in a single night they did it they began again to prepare the field and to prepare the soil and cut the trees they talked over what they would have to do with the trees which they had cut and the weeds which they had pulled up now we shall watch over our cornfield perhaps we can surprise those who come to do all of this damage they said talking it over together and later they returned home what do you think of it grandmother they have made fun of us our field which we had worked has been turned into a field of stubble and a thick woods thus we found it when we got there a little while ago grandmother they said to her and to their mother but we shall return there and watch over it because it is not right that they do such things to us they said then they dressed and returned at once to their field of cut trees and there they hid themselves stealthily in the darkness then all the animals gathered again one of each kind came with the other small and large animals it was just midnight when they came all talking as they came saying in their own language rise up trees rise up vines so they spoke when they came and gathered under the trees under the vines and they came closer until they appeared before the eyes of hunahpú and xbalanqué the puma and the jaguar were the first and hunahpú and xbalanqué wanted to seize them but the animals did not let them then the deer and the rabbit came close and the only parts of them which they could seize were their tails only these they pulled out the tall of the deer remained in their hands and for this reason the deer and the rabbit have short tails neither the mountaincat the coyote the wild boar nor the coati fell into their hands all the animals passed before hunahpú and xbalanqué who were furious because they could not catch them but finally another animal came hopping along and this one which was the rat which they seized instantly and wrapped him in a cloth then when they had caught him they squeezed his head and tried to choke him and they burned his tall in the fire and for that reason the rats tail has no hair so too the boys hunahpú and xbalanqué tried to poke at his eyes the rat said i must not die at your hands and neither is it your business to plant the cornfield what are you telling us now the boys asked the rat loosen me a little for i have something which i wish to tell you and i shall tell you immediately but first give me something to eat said the rat we will give you food afterward but first speak they answered very well do you know then that the property of your parents hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú as they were called those who died in xibalba or rather the gear with which they played ball has remained and is hanging from the roof of the house the ring the gloves and the ball nevertheless your grandmother does not want to show them to you for it was on account of these things that your parents died are you sure of that said the boys to the rat and they were very happy when they heard about the rubber ball and as the rat had now talked they showed the rat what his food would be this shall be your food corn chiliseeds beans pataxte cacao all this belongs to you and should there be anything stored away or forgotten it shall be yours also eat it hunahpú and xbalanqué said to the rat wonderful boys he said but what shall i tell your grandmother if she sees me do not worry because we are here and shall know what to say to our grandmother let us go we shall go quickly to the comer of the house go at once to where the things hang we shall be looking at the garret of the house and paying attention to our food they said to the rat and having arranged it thus during the night after talking together hunahpú and xbalanqué arrived at midday when they arrived they brought the rat with them but they did not show it one of them went directly into the house and the other went to the corner and there let the rat climb up quickly immediately they asked their grandmother for food prepare our food we wish a chilisauce grandmother they said and at once the food was prepared for them and a plate of broth was put before them but this was only to deceive their grandmother and their mother and having dried up the water which was in the water jar they said we are really dying of thirst go and bring us a drink they said to their grandmother good she said and went then they began to eat but they were not really hungry it was only a trick they saw then by means of their plate of chile how the rat went rapidly toward the ball which was suspended from the roof of the house on seeing this in their chilesauce they sent to the river a certain xan an animal called xan which is like a mosquito to puncture the side of their grandmothers water jar and although she tried to stop the water which ran out she could not close the hole made in the jar what is the matter with our grandmother our mouths are dry with thirst we are dying of thirst they said to their mother and they sent her out immediately the rat went to cut the cord which held the ball and it fell from the garret of the house together with the ring and the gloves and the leather pads the boys seized them and ran quickly to hide them on the road which led to the ballcourt after this they went to the river to join their grandmother and their mother who were busily trying to stop the hole in the water jar and arriving with their blowgun they said when they came to the river what are you doing we got tired of waiting and we came they said look at the hole in my jar which i cannot stop said the grandmother instantly they stopped it and together they returned the two walking before their grandmother and in this way the ball was found the boys returned happily to the ballcourt to play they were playing alone a long time and cleared the court where their parents had played and the lords of xibalba hearing them said who are they who play again over our heads and disturb us with the noise they make perchance hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú did not die those who wished to exalt themselves before us go at once and call them so said huncamé vucubcamé and all the lords and sending the messengers to call them they said to them go and tell them when you get there let them come the lords have said we wish to play ball with them here within seven days we wish to play tell them so when you arrive thus said the lords this was the command which they gave to the messengers and they came then by the wide road which the boys had made that led directly to their house by it the messengers arrived directly before the boys grandmother they were eating when the messengers from xibalba arrived tell them to come without fail the lords commanded said the messengers of xibalba and the messengers of xibalba indicated the day within seven days they will await them they said to xmucané it is well messengers they will go the old woman answered and the messengers set out on their return then the old womans heart was filled with anxiety who shall i send to call my grandchildren was it not in this same way that the messengers of xibalba came before when they came to take the boys parents said the grandmother entering her house alone and grieving and immediately a louse fell into her lap she seized it and put it in the palm of her hand and the louse wriggled and began to walk my child would you like that i sent you away to call my grandchildren from the ballcourt she said to the louse messengers have come to your grandmother tell them come within seven days tell them to come said the messengers of xibalba thus your grandmother told me to say thus she told the louse at once the louse swaggered off sitting on the road was a boy called tamazul or the toad where are you going the toad said to the louse i am carrying a message in my stomach i go to find the boys said the louse to tamazul very well but i see that you do not go quickly said the toad to the louse do you not want me to swallow you you shall see how i run and so we shall arrive quickly very well the louse said to the toad immediately the toad swallowed him and the toad walked a long time but without hurrying soon he met a large snake called zaquicaz where are you going young tamazul said zaquicaz to the toad i go as a messenger i carry a message in my stomach said the toad to the snake see that you do not walk quickly would i not arrive sooner the snake said to the toad come here he said at once zaquicaz swallowed the toad and from then on this was the food of snakes who still today swallow toads the snake went quickly and having met vac which is a very large bird the hawk the latter instantly swallowed the snake shortly afterward it arrived at the ballcourt from that time this has been the food of hawks who devour snakes in the fields and upon arrival the hawk perched upon the cornice of the ballcourt where hunahpú and xbalanqué were amusing themselves playing ball upon arriving the hawk began to cry vaccó vaccó it said cawing here is the hawk here is the hawk who is screaming bring our blowguns the boys exclaimed and shooting at the hawk they aimed a pellet at the pupil of the eye and the hawk spiraled to the ground they ran to seize it and asked what do you come to do here they asked the hawk i bring a message in my stomach first cure my eye and afterward i shall tell you the hawk answered very well they said and taking a bit of the rubber of the ball with which they were playing they put it in the hawks eye lotzquic they called it and instantly the hawks eye was perfectly healed speak then they said to the hawk and immediately it vomited a large snake speak thou they said to the snake good the snake said and vomited the toad where is the message that you bring they asked the toad herein my stomach is the message answered the toad and immediately he tried but could not vomit his mouth only filled with spittle but he did not vomit the boys wanted to hit him then you are a liar they said kicking him in the rump and the bone of the haunches gave way he tried again but his mouth only filled with spittle then the boys opened the toads mouth and once open they looked inside of it the louse was stuck to the toads teeth it had stayed in its mouth and had not been swallowed but only pretended to be swallowed thus the toad was tricked and the kind of food to give it is not known it cannot run and it became the food of the snakes speak they said to the louse and then it gave its message your grandmother has said boys go call them the messengers of huncamé and vucubcamé have come to tell them to go to xibalba saying they must come here within seven days to play ball with us and they must also bring their playing gear the ball the rings the gloves the leather pads in order that they may amuse themselves here said the lords they have really come said your grandmother that is why i have come for truly your grandmother said this and she cries and grieves for this reason i have come is it true the boys asked themselves when they heard this and running quickly they arrived at their grandmothers side they went only to take their leave of her we are going grandmother we came only to say goodbye but here will be the sign which we shall leave of our fate each of us shall plant a reed in the middle of the house we shall plant it if it dries this shall be the sign of our death they are dead you shall say if it begins to dry up but if it sprouts again they are living you shall say oh our grandmother and you mother do not weep for here we leave the sign of our fate thus they said and before going hunahpú planted one reed and xbalanqué planted another they planted them in the house and not in the field nor did they plant them in moist soil but in dry soil in the middle of their house they left them planted then they went each one carrying his blowgun and went down in the direction of xibalba they descended the steps quickly and passed between several streams and ravines they passed among some birds and these birds were called molay they also passed over a river of corruption and over a river of blood where they would be destroyed so the people of xibalba thought but they did not touch it with their feet instead they crossed it on their blowguns they went on from there and came to a crossway of four roads they knew very well which were the roads to xibalba the black road the white road the red road and the green road so then they sent an animal called xan it was to go to gather information which they wanted sting them one by one first sting the one seated in the first place and then sting all of them since this is the part you must play to suck the blood of the men on the roads they said to the mosquito very well answered the mosquito and immediately it flew on to the dark road and went directly toward the wooden men which were seated first and covered with ornaments it stung the first but this one said nothing then it stung the next one it stung the second who was seated but this one said nothing either after that it stung the third the third of those seated was huncamé ah he exclaimed when it stung him what is this huncamé what is it that has stung you do you not know who has stung you said the fourth one of the lords who were seated what is the matter vucubcamé what has stung you said the fifth ah ah then said xiquiripat and vucubcamé asked him what has stung you and when they stung the sixth who was seated he cried ah what is this cuchumaquic asked xiquiripat what is it that has stung you and the seventh one seated said ah when he was stung what is the matter ahalpuh said cuchumaquic what has stung you and when it stung him the eighth of those seated said ah what is the matter ahalcaná said ahalpuh what has stung you and when he was stung the ninth of those seated said ah what is this chamiabac said ahalcaná what has stung you and when the tenth of those seated was stung he said ah what is the matter chamiaholom said chamiabac what has stung you and when the eleventh of those seated was stung he said ah what happened said chamiaholom what has stung you and when the twelfth of those seated was stung he said alas what is this patán they said what has stung you and the thirteenth of those seated said alas when he was stung what is the matter quicxic said patán what has stung you and the fourteenth of those seated when he was stung said alas what has stung you quicrixcac said quicré in this way they told their names as they all said them one to the other so they made themselves known by telling their names calling each chief one by one and in this manner each of those seated in his comer told his name not a single one of the names was missed all told their names when hunahpú puffed out a hair of his leg which was what had stung them it was really not a mosquito which stung them which went for hunahpú and xbalanqué to hear the names of all of them they the youths continued on their way and arrived where the lords of xibalba were greet the lord the one who is seated said one in order to deceive them that is not a lord it is nothing more than a wooden figure they said and went on immediately they began to greet them hail huncamé hail vucubcamé hail xiquiripat hail cuchumaquic hail ahalpuh hail ahalcaná hail chamiabac hail chamiaholom hail quicxic hail patán hail quicré hail quicrixcac they said coming before them and looking in their faces they spoke the name of all without missing the name of a single one of them but what the lords wished was that they should not discover their names sit here they said hoping that they would sit in the seat which they indicated that is not a seat for us it is only a hot stone said hunahpú and xbalanqué and they the lords of xibalba could not overcome them very well go to that house the lords said and they the youths went on and entered the house of gloom and neither there were they overcome this was the first test of xibalba the lords of xibalba thought that the boys entrance there would be the beginning of their downfall after a while the boys entered the house of gloom immediately lighted sticks of fat pine were given them and the messengers of huncamé also took a cigar to each one these are their pine sticks said the lord they must return them at dawn tomorrow together with the cigars and you must bring them back whole said the lord so said the messengers when they arrived very well the boys replied but they really did not light the sticks of pine instead they put a redcolored thing in place of them or some feathers from the tail of the macaw which to the night watches looked like lighted pine sticks and as for the cigars they attached fireflies to their end all night everybody thought they were defeated they are lost said the night watchmen but the pine sticks had not been burned and looked the same and the cigars had not been lighted and looked the same as before they went to tell the lords how is this whence have they come who conceived them who gave birth to them this really troubles us because it is not well what they do their faces are strange and strange is their conduct they said to each other soon all the lords summoned the boys eh let us play ball boys they said at the same time they were questioned by huncamé and vucubcamé where did you come from tell us boys said the lords of xibalba who knows whence we came we do not know they said and nothing more very well let us play ball boys said the lords of xibalba good they replied we shall use our ball said the lords of xibalba by no means shall you use your ball but ours the boys answered not that one but ours we shall use insisted the lords of xibalba very well said the boys let us play for a worm the chil said the lords of xibalba no but instead the head of the puma shall speak said the boys not that said those of xibalba very well said hunahpú then the lords of xibalba seized the ball they threw it directly at the ring of hunahpú immediately while those of xibalba grasped the handle of the knife of flint the ball rebounded and bounced all around the floor of the ballcourt what is this exclaimed hunahpú and xbalanqué you wish to kill us perchance you did not send to call us and your own messengers did not come in truth unfortunate are we we shall leave at once the boys said to them this was exactly what those of xibalba wanted to have happen to the boys that they would die immediately right there in the ballcourt and thus they would be overcome but it did not happen thus and it was the lords of xibalba who were defeated by the boys do not leave boys let us go on playing ball but we shall use your ball they said to the boys very well the boys answered and then they drove their ball through the ring of xibalba and with this the game ended and offended by their defeat the men of xibalba immediately said what shall we do in order to overcome them and turning to the boys they said to them go gather and bring us early tomorrow morning four gourds of flowers so said the men of xibalba to the boys very well and what kind of flowers they asked the men of xibalba a branch of red chiptlín a branch of white chiptlín a branch of yellow chiptlín and a branch of carinimac said the men of xibalba very well replied the boys thus the talk ended equally strong and vigorous were the words of the boys and their hearts were calm when they gave themselves up to be overcome the lords of xibalba were happy thinking that they had already defeated them this has turned out well for us first they must cut them the flowers said the lords of xibalba where shall they go to get the flowers they said to themselves surely you will give us our flowers tomorrow early go then to cut them the lords of xibalba said to hunahpú and xbalanqué very well they replied at dawn we shall play ball again they said upon leaving and immediately the boys entered the house of knives the second place of torture in xibalba and what the lords wanted was that they would be cut to pieces by the knives and would be quickly killed that is what they wished in their hearts but the boys did not die they spoke at once to the knives and said to them yours shall be the flesh of all the animals they said to the knives and they did not move again but all the knives were quiet thus they passed the night in the house of knives and calling all the ants they said to them come cutting ants come zompopos and all of you go at once go and bring all the kinds of flowers that we must cut for the lords very well they said and all the ants went to bring the flowers from the gardens of huncamé and vucubcamé previously the lords had warned the guards of the flowers of xibalba take care of our flowers do not let them be taken by the boys who shall come to cut them but how could the boys see and cut the flowers not at all watch then all night very well they answered but the guards of the garden heard nothing needlessly they shouted up into the branches of the trees in the garden there they were all night repeating their same shouts and songs ixpurpuvec ixpurpuvec one shouted puhuyú puhuyú the other answered puhuyú was the name of the two who watched the garden of huncamé and vucubcamé but they did not notice the ants who were robbing them of what they were guarding turning around and moving here and there cutting the flowers climbing the trees to cut the flowers and gathering them from the ground at the foot of the trees meanwhile the guards went on crying and they did not feel the teeth which were cutting their tails and their wings and thus the ants carried between their teeth the flowers which they took down and gathering them from the ground they went on carrying them with their teeth quickly they filled the four gourds with flowers which were moist with dew when it dawned immediately the messengers arrived to get them tell them to come the lord has said and bring here instantly what they have cut they said to the boys very well the boys answered and carrying the flowers in the four gourds they went and when they arrived before the lord of xibalba and the other lords it was lovely to see the flowers they had brought and in this way the lords of xibalba were overcome the boys had only sent the ants to cut the flowers and in a night the ants cut them and put them in the gourds instantly the lords of xibalba paled and their faces became livid because of the flowers they sent at once for the guardians of the flowers why did you permit them to steal our flowers these which we see here are our flowers they said to the guardians we noticed nothing my lord our tails also suffered they answered and then the lords tore at their mouths as a punishment for having let that which was under their care be stolen thus were huncamé and vucubcamé defeated by hunahpú and xbalanqué and this was the beginning of their deeds from that time the mouth of the owl is divided cleft as it is today immediately they went down to play ball and also they played several tiematches then they finished playing and agreed to play again the following day at dawn so said the lords of xibalba it is well said the boys upon finishing afterward they entered the house of cold it is impossible to describe how cold it was the house was full of hail it was the mansion of cold soon however the cold was ended because with a fire of old logs the boys made the cold disappear that is why they did not die they were still alive when it dawned surely what the lords of xibalba wanted was that they would die but it was not thus and when it dawned they were still full of health and they went out again when the messengers came to get them how is this they are not dead yet said the lords of xibalba they were amazed to see the deeds of hunahpú and xbalanqué presently the boys entered the house of jaguars the house was full of jaguars do not bite us here is what belongs to you the boys said to the jaguars and quickly they threw some bones to the animals which pounced upon the bones now surely they are finished now already they have eaten their own entrails at last they have given themselves up now their bones have been broken so said the guards all happy because of this but they the boys did not die as usual well and healthy they came out of the house of jaguars what kind of people are they where did they come from said all the lords of xibalba presently they the boys entered into the midst of fire in the house of fire inside which there was only fire but they were not burned only the coals and the wood burned and as usual they were well when it dawned but what they the lords of xibalba wished was that the boys would die rapidly where they had been nevertheless it did not happen thus which disheartened the lords of xibalba then they put them into the house of bats there was nothing but bats inside this house the house of camazotz a large animal whose weapons for killing were like a dry point and instantly those who came into their presence perished they the boys were in there then but they slept inside their blowguns and they were not bitten by those who were in the house nevertheless one of them had to give up because of another camazotz that came from the sky and made him come into sight the bats were assembled in council all night and flew about quilitz quilitz they said so they were saying all night they stopped for a little while however and they did not move and were pressed against the end of one of the blowguns then xbalanqué said to hunahpú look you has it begun already to get light maybe so i am going to see hunahpú answered and as he wished very much to look out of the mouth of the blowgun and wished to see if it had dawned instantly camazotz cut off his head and the body of hunahpú was decapitated xbalanqué asked again has it not yet dawned but hunahpú did not move where have you gone hunahpú what have you done but he did not move and remained silent then xbalanqué felt concerned and exclaimed unfortunate are we we are completely undone they went immediately to hang the head of hunahpú in the ballcourt by special order of huncamé and vucubcamé and all the people of xibalba rejoiced for what had happened to the head of hunahpú immediately he xbalanqué called all the animals the coati the wild boar all the animals small and large during the night and at dawn he asked them what their food was what does each of you eat for i have called you so that you may choose your food said xbalanqué to them very well they answered and immediately each went to take his own food and they all went together some went to take rotten things others went to take grasses others went to get stones others went to gather earth varied was the food of the small animals and of the large animals behind them the turtle was lingering it came waddling along to take its food and reaching at the end of hunahpús body it assumed the form of the head of hunahpú and instantly the eyes were fashioned many soothsayers came then from heaven the heart of heaven huracán came to soar over the house of bats it was not easy to finish making the face but it turned out very well the hair had a handsome appearance and the head could also speak but as it was about to dawn and the horizon reddened make it dark again old one the buzzard was told very well said the old one and instantly the old one darkened the sky now the buzzard has darkened it the people say nowadays and so during the cool of dawn the hunahpú began his existence will it be good they said will it turn out to look like hunahpú it is very good they answered and really it seemed that the skull had changed itself back into a real head then they the two boys talked among themselves and agreed do not play ball only pretend to play i shall do everything alone said xbalanqué at once he gave his orders to a rabbit go and take your place over the ballcourt stay there within the oak grove the rabbit was told by xbalanqué when the ball comes to you run out immediately and i shall do the rest the rabbit was told when they gave him these instructions during the night presently day broke and the two boys were well and healthy then they went down to play ball the head of hunahpú was suspended over the ballcourt we have triumphed said the lords of xibalbayou worked your own destruction you have delivered yourselves they said in this way they annoyed hunahpú hit his head with the ball they said but they did not bother him with it he paid no attention to it then the lords of xibalba threw out the ball xbalanqué went out to get it the ball was going straight to the ring but it stopped bounced and passed quickly over the ballcourt and with a jump went toward the oak grove instantly the rabbit ran out and went hopping and the lords of xibalba ran after it they went making noise and shouting after the rabbit it ended by all of the lords of xibalba going at once xbalanqué took possession of the head of hunahpú and taking the turtle he went to suspend it over the ballcourt and that head was actually the head of hunahpú and the two boys were very happy those of xibalba ran then to find the ball and having found it between the oaks called them saying come here here is the ball we found it they said and they brought it when the lords of xibalba returned they exclaimed what is this we see then they began to play again both of them tied presently xbalanqué threw a stone at the turtle which came to the ground and fell in the ballcourt breaking into a thousand pieces like seeds before the lords who of you shall go to find it where is the one who shall go to bring it said the lords of xibalba and so were the lords of xibalba overcome by hunahpú and xbalanqué these two suffered great hardships but they did not die despite all that was done to them here is the account of the death of hunahpú and xbalanqué now we shall tell of the way they died having been forewarned of all the suffering which the lords of xibalba wished to impose upon them they did not die of the tortures of xibalba nor were they overcome by all the fierce animals which were in xibalba afterward they sent for two soothsayers who were like prophets they were called xulú and pacam and were diviners and they said unto them you shall be questioned by the lords of xibalba about our deaths for which they are planning and preparing because of the fact that we have not died nor have they been able to overcome us nor have we perished under their torments nor have the animals attacked us we have the presentiment in our hearts that they shall kill us by burning us all the people of xibalba have assembled but the truth is that we shall not die here then you have our instructions as to what you must say if they should come to consult you about our death and that we may be sacrificed what shall you say then xulú and pacam if they ask you will it not be good to throw their bones into the ravine no it would not be well tell them because they would be brought to life again afterward if they ask you would it not be good to hang them from the trees you shall answer by no means would it be well because then you shall see their faces again and when for the third time they ask you would it be good to throw their bones into the river if you were asked all the above by them you should answer it would be well if they were to die that way then it would be well to crush their bones on a grinding stone as corn meal is ground let each one be ground separately throw them into the river immediately there where the spring gushes forth in order that they may be carried away among all the small and large hills thus you shall answer them when the plan which we have advised you is put into practice said hunahpú and xbalanqué and when they the boys took leave of them they already knew about their approaching death they made then a great bonfire a kind of oven the men of xibalba made it and filled it with thick branches shortly afterward the messengers arrived who had to accompany the boys the messengers of huncamé and vucubcamé tell them to come go and get the boys go there so that they may know we are going to burn them this the lords said oh boys the messengers exclaimed it is well they answered and setting out quickly they arrived near the bonfire there the lords of xibalba wanted to force the boys to play a mocking game with them let us drink our chicha and fly four times each one over the bonfire boys was said to them by huncamé do not try to deceive usthe boys answered perchance we do not know about our death oh lords and that this is what awaits us here and embracing each other face to face they both stretched out their arms bent toward the ground and jumped into the bonfire and thus the two died together all those of xibalba were filled with joy shouting and whistling they exclaimed now we have overcome them at last they have given themselves up immediately they called xulú and pacam to whom they the boys had given their instructions and asked them what they must do with their bones as they the boys had foretold those of xibalba then ground their bones and went to cast them into the river but the bones did not go very far for settling themselves down at once on the bottom of the river they were changed back into handsome boys and when again they showed themselves they really had their same old faces on the fifth day they appeared again and were seen in the water by the people both had the appearance of fishmen when those of xibalba saw them after having hunted them all over the river and the following day two poor men presented themselves with very oldlooking faces and of miserable appearance and ragged clothes whose countenances did not commend them so they were seen by all those of xibalba and what they did was very little they only performed the dance of the puhuy owl or chumowl the dance of the cux weasel and the dance of the iboy armadillo and they also danced the xtzul centipede and the chitic that walks on stilts furthermore they worked many miracles they burned houses as though they really were burning and instantly they were as they had been before many of those of xibalba watched them in wonder presently they cut themselves into bits they killed each other the first one whom they had killed stretched out as though he were dead and instantly the other brought him back to life those of xibalba looked on in amazement at all they did and they performed it as the beginning of their triumph over those of xibalba presently word of their dances came to the ears of the lords huncamé and vucubcamé upon hearing it they exclaimed who are these two orphans do they really give you so much pleasure surely their dances are very beautiful and all that they do answered he who had brought the news to the lords happy to hear this the lords then sent their messengers to call the boys with flattery tell them to come here tell them to come so that we may see what they do that we may admire them and regard them with wonder this the lords said so you shall say unto them this was told to the messengers they arrived at once before the dancers and gave them the message of the lords we do not wish to the boys answered because frankly we are ashamed how could we not but be ashamed to appear in the house of the lords with our ugly countenances our eyes which are so big and our poor appearance do you not see that we are nothing more than some poor dancers what shall we tell our companions in poverty who have come with us and wish to see our dances and be entertained by them how could we do our dances before the lords for that reason then we do not want to go oh messengers said hunahpú and xbalanqué finally with downcast faces and with reluctance and sorrow they went but for a while they did not wish to walk and the messengers had to beat them in the face many times when they led them to the house of the lords they arrived then before the lords timid and with head bowed they came prostrating themselves making reverences and humiliating themselves they looked feeble ragged and their appearance was really that of vagabonds when they arrived they were questioned immediately about their country and their people they also asked them about their mother and their father where do you come from the lords said we do not know sir we do not know the faces of our mother and father we were small when they died they answered and did not say another word all right now do your dances so that we may admire you what do you want we shall give you pay they told them we do not want anything but really we are very much afraid they said to the lord do not grieve do not be afraid dance and do first the part in which you kill yourselves burn my house do all that you know how to do we shall marvel at you for that is what our hearts desire and afterwards poor things we shall give help for your journey they told them then they began to sing and dance all the people of xibalba arrived and gathered together in order to see them then they performed the dance of the cux they danced the puhuy and they danced the iboy and the lord said to them cut my dog into pieces and let him be brought back to life by you he said to them very well they answered and cut the dog into bits instantly they brought him back to life the dog was truly full of joy when he was brought back to life and wagged his tail when they revived him the lord said to them then burn my house now thus he said to them instantly they put fire to the lords house and although all the lords were assembled together within the house they were not burned quickly it was whole again and not for one instant was the house of huncamé destroyed all of the lords were amazed and in the same way the boys dances gave them much pleasure then they were told by the lord now kill a man sacrifice him but do not let him die he told them very well they answered and seizing a man they quickly sacrificed him and raising his heart on high they held it so that all the lords could see it again huncamé and vucubcamé were amazed a moment afterward the man was brought back to life by them the boys and his heart was filled with joy when he was revived the lords were astounded sacrifice yourselves now let us see it we really like your dances said the lords very well sirs they answered and they proceeded to sacrifice each other hunahpú was sacrificed by xbalanqué one by one his arms and his legs were sliced off his head was cut from his body and carried away his heart was torn from his breast and thrown onto the grass all the lords of xibalba were fascinated they looked on in wonder but really it was only the dance of one man it was xbalanqué get up he said and instantly hunahpú returned to life they the boys were very happy and the lords were also happy in truth what they did gladdened the hearts of huncamé and vucubcamé and the latter felt as though they themselves were dancing then their hearts were filled with desire and longing by the dances of hunahpú and xbalanqué and huncamé and vucubcamé gave their commands do the same with us sacrifice us they said cut us into pieces one by one huncamé and vucubcamé said to hunahpú and xbalanqué very well afterward you will come back to life again perchance did you not bring us here in order that we should entertain you the lords and your sons and vassals they said to the lords and so it happened that they first sacrificed the one who was the chief and lord of xibalba the one called huncamé king of xibalba and when huncamé was dead they overpowered vucubcamé and they did not bring either of them back to life the people of xibalba fled as soon as they saw that their lords were dead and sacrificed in an instant both were sacrificed and this they the boys did in order to chastize them quickly the principal lord was killed and they did not bring him back to life and another lord humbled himself then and presented himself before the dancers they had not discovered him nor had they found him have mercy on me he said when they found him all the sons and vassals of xibalba fled to a great ravine and all of them were crowded into this narrow deep place there they were crowded together and hordes of ants came and found them and dislodged them from the ravine in this way the ants drove them to the road and when they arrived the people prostrated themselves and gave themselves up they humbled themselves and arrived grieving in this way the lords of xibalba were overcome only by a miracle and by their own transformation could the boys have done it immediately the boys told their names and they extolled themselves before all the people of xibalba hear our names we shall also tell you the names of our fathers we are hunahpú and xbalanqué those are our names and our fathers are those whom you killed and who were called hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú we those whom you see here are then the avengers of the torments and suffering of our fathers that is the reason why we resent all the evil you have done to them therefore we shall put an end to all of you we shall kill you and not one of you shall escape they said instantly all the people of xibalba fell to their knees crying have mercy on us hunahpú and xbalanqué it is true that we sinned against your fathers as you said and that they are buried in puchbalchah they said very well this is our sentence that we are going to tell you hear it all you of xibalba since neither your great power nor your race any longer exist and since neither do you deserve mercy your rank shall be lowered not for you shall be the ball game you shall spend your time making earthen pots and tubs and stones to grind corn only the children of the thickets and desert shall speak with you the noble sons the civilized vassals shall not consort with you and they will foresake your presence the sinners the evil ones the sad ones the unfortunate ones those who give themselves up to vice these are the ones who will welcome you no longer will you seize men suddenly for sacrifice remember your rank has been lowered thus they spoke to all the people of xibalba in this way their destruction and their lamentations began their power in the olden days was not much they only liked to do evil to men in those times in truth in those days they did not have the category of gods furthermore their horrible faces frightened people they were the enemies the owls they incited to evil to sin and to discord they were also false in their hearts black and white at the same time envious and tyrannical according to what was said of them furthermore they painted and greased their faces in this way then occurred the loss of their grandeur and the decadence of their empire and this was what hunahpú and xbalanqué did meanwhile the grandmother was crying and lamenting before the reeds which they had left planted the reeds sprouted then they dried up when the boys were consumed in the bonfire afterward the reeds sprouted again then the grandmother lighted the fire and burned incense before the reeds in memory of her grandchildren and the grandmothers heart filled with joy when for the second time the reeds sprouted then they were worshiped by the grandmother and she called them the center of the house nicah the center they were called green reeds growing in the plains cazam ah chatam uleu was their name and they were called the center of the house and the center because in the middle of the house they planted the reeds and the reeds which were planted were called the plains green reeds growing on the plains they also were called green reeds because they had resprouted this name was given them by xmucané given to those reeds which hunahpú and xbalanqué left planted in order that they should be remembered by their grandmother well now their fathers those who died long ago were hunhunahpú and vucubhunahpú they also saw the faces of their fathers there in xibalba and their fathers talked with their descendants that is the ones who overthrew those of xibalba and here is how their fathers were honored by them they honored vucubhunahpú they went to honor him at the place of sacrifice of the ballcourt and at the same time they wanted to make vucubhunahpús face they hunted there for his entire body his mouth his nose his eyes they found his body but it could do very little it could not pronounce his name this hunahpú neither could his mouth say it and here is how they extolled the memory of their fathers whom they had left there in the place of sacrifice at the ballcourt you shall be invoked their sons said to them when they fortified their heart you shall be the first to arise and you shall be the first to be worshiped by the sons of the noblemen by the civilized vassals your names shall not be lost so it shall be they told their fathers and thus consoled themselves we are the avengers of your death of the pains and sorrows which they caused you thus was their leavetaking when they had already overcome all the people of xibalba then they rose up in the midst of the light and instantly they were lifted into the sky one was given the sun the other the moon then the arch of heaven and the face of the earth were lighted and they dwelt in heaven then the four hundred boys whom zipacná had killed also ascended and so they again became the companions of the boys and were changed into stars in the sky here then is the beginning of when it was decided to make man and when what must enter into the flesh of man was sought and the forefathers the creators and makers who were called tepeu and gucumatz said the time of dawn has come let the work be finished and let those who are to nourish and sustain us appear the noble sons the civilized vassals let man appear humanity on the face of the earth thus they spoke they assembled came together and held council in the darkness and in the night then they sought and discussed and here they reflected and thought in this way their decisions came dearly to light and they found and discovered what must enter into the flesh of man it was just before the sun the moon and the stars appeared over the creators and makers from paxil from cayalá as they were called came the yellow ears of corn and the white ears of corn these are the names of the animals which brought the food yac the mountain cat utiú the coyote quel a small parrot and hoh the crow these four animals gave tidings of the yellow ears of corn and the white ears of corn they told them that they should go to paxil and they showed them the road to paxil and thus they found the food and this was what went into the flesh of created man the made man this was his blood of this the blood of man was made so the corn entered into the formation of man by the work of the forefathers and in this way they were filled with joy because they had found a beautiful land full of pleasures abundant in ears of yellow corn and ears of white corn and abundant also in pataxte and cacao and in innumerable zapotes anonas jocotes nantzes matasanos and honey there was an abundance of delicious food in those villages called paxil and cayalá there were foods of every kind small and large foods small plants and large plants the animals showed them the road and then grinding the yellow corn and the white corn xmucané made nine drinks and from this food came the strength and the flesh and with it they created the muscles and the strength of man this the forefathers did tepeu and gucumatz as they were called after that they began to talk about the creation and the making of our first mother and father of yellow corn and of white corn they made their flesh of cornmeal dough they made the arms and the legs of man only dough of corn meal went into the flesh of our first fathers the four men who were created these are the names of the first men who were created and formed the first man was balamquitzé the second balamacab the third mahucutah and the fourth was iquibalam these are the names of our first mothers and fathers it is said that they only were made and formed they had no mother they had no father they were only called men they were not born of woman nor were they begotten by the creator nor by the maker nor by the forefathers only by a miracle by means of incantation were they created and made by the creator the maker the forefathers tepeu and gucumatz and as they had the appearance of men they were men they talked conversed saw and heard walked grasped things they were good and handsome men and their figure was the figure of a man they were endowed with intelligence they saw and instantly they could see far they succeeded in seeing they succeeded in knowing all that there is in the world when they looked instantly they saw all around them and they contemplated in turn the arch of heaven and the round face of the earth the things hidden in the distance they saw all without first having to move at once they saw the world and so too from where they were they saw it great was their wisdom their sight reached to the forests the rocks the lakes the seas the mountains and the valleys in truth they were admirable men balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam then the creator and the maker asked them what do you think of your condition do you not see do you not hear are not your speech and manner of walking good look then contemplate the world look and see if the mountains and the valleys appear try then to see they said to the four first men and immediately they the four first men began to see all that was in the world then they gave thanks to the creator and the maker we really give you thanks two and three times we have been created we have been given a mouth and a face we speak we hear we think and walk we feel perfectly and we know what is far and what is near we also see the large and the small in the sky and on earth we give you thanks then for having created us oh creator and maker for having given us being oh our grandmother oh our grandfather they said giving thanks for their creation and formation they were able to know all and they examined the four comers the four points of the arch of the sky and the round face of the earth but the creator and the maker did not hear this with pleasure it is not well what our creatures our works say they know all the large and the small they said and so the forefathers held counsel again what shall we do with them now let their sight reach only to that which is near let them see only a little of the face of the earth it is not well what they say perchance are they not by nature simple creatures of our making must they also be gods and if they do not reproduce and multiply when it will dawn when the sun rises and what if they do not multiply so they spoke let us check a little their desires because it is not well what we see must they perchance be the equals of ourselves their makers who can see afar who know all and see all thus spoke the heart of heaven huracán chipicaculhá raxacaculhá tepeu gucumatz the forefathers xpiyacoc xmucané the creator and the maker thus they spoke and immediately they changed the nature of their works of their creatures then the heart of heaven blew mist into their eyes which clouded their sight as when a mirror is breathed upon their eyes were covered and they could see only what was close only that was clear to them in this way the wisdom and all the knowledge of the four men the origin and beginning of the quiché race were destroyed in this way were created and formed our grandfathers our fathers by the heart of heaven the heart of earth then their wives had being and their women were made god himself made them carefully and so during sleep they came truly beautiful their women at the side of balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam there were their women when they awakened and instantly their hearts were filled with joy because of their wives here are the names of their wives cahápaluna was the name of the wife of balamquitzé chomihá was the wife of balamacab tzununihá the wife of mahucutah and caquixahá was the name of the wife of iquibalam these are the names of their wives who were distinguished women they conceived the men of the small tribes and of the large tribes and were the origin of us the people of quiché there were many priests and sacrificers there were not only four but those four were the forefathers of us the people of the quiché the names of each one were different when they multiplied there in the east and there were many names of the people tepeu olomán cohah quenech ahau as they called those men there in the east where they multiplied the beginning is known too of those of tamub and those of ilocab who came together from there in the east balamquitzé was the grandfather and the father of the nine great houses of the cavec balamacab was the grandfather and father of the nine great houses of the nimhaib mahucutah the grandfather and father of the four great houses of ahauquiché three groups of families existed but they did not forget the name of their grandfather and father those who propagated and multiplied there in the east the tamub and ilocab also came and thirteen branches of peoples the thirteen of tecpán and those of rabinal the cakchiquel those from tziquinahá and the zacahá and the lamaq cumatz tuhalhá uchabahá those of chumilahá those of quibahá of batenabá aculvinac balamihá the canchahel and balamcolob these are only the principal tribes the branches of the people which we mention only of the principal ones shall we speak many others came from each group of the people but we shall not write their names they also multiplied there in the east many men were made and in the darkness they multiplied neither the sun nor the light had yet been made when they multiplied all lived together they existed in great number and walked there in the east nevertheless they did not sustain nor maintain their god they only raised their faces to the sky and they did not know why they had come so far as they did there they were then in great number the black men and the white men men of many classes men of many tongues that it was wonderful to hear them there are generations in the world there are country people whose faces we do not see who have no homes they only wander through the small and large woodlands like crazy people so it is said scornfully of the people of the wood so they said there where they saw the rising of the sun the speech of all was the same they did not invoke wood nor stone and they remembered the word of the creator and the maker the heart of heaven the heart of earth in this manner they spoke while they thought about the coming of the dawn and they raised their prayers those worshipers of the word of god loving obedient and fearful raising their faces to the sky when they asked for daughters and sons oh thou tzacol bitol look at us hear us do not leave us do not forsake us oh god who art in heaven and on earth heart of heaven heart of earth give us our descendants our succession as long as the sun shall move and there shall be light let it dawn let the day come give us many good roads flat roads may the people have peace much peace and may they be happy and give us good life and useful existence oh thou huracán chipicaculhá raxácaculhá chipinanauac raxánanauac voc hunahpú tepeu gucumatz alom qaholom xpiyacoc xmucané grandmother of the sun grandmother of the light let there be dawn and let the light come thus they spoke while they saw and invoked the coming of the sun the arrival of day and at the same time that they saw the rising of the sun they contemplated the morning star the great star which comes ahead of the sun that lights up the arch of the sky and the surface of the earth and illuminates the steps of the men who had been created and made balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam said let us await the break of day so said those great wise men the enlightened men the priests and sacrificers this they said our first mothers and fathers did not yet have wood nor stones to keep but their hearts were tired of waiting for the sun already all the tribes and the yaqui people the priests and sacrificers were very many let us go let us go to search and see if our tribal symbols are in safety if we can find what we must burn before them for being as we are there is no one who watches for us said balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam and having heard of a city they went there now then the name of the place where balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam and those of tamub and ilocab went was tulánzuivá vucubpec vucubziván this was the name of the city where they went to receive their gods so then all arrived at tulán it was impossible to count the men who arrived there were very many and they walked in an orderly way then was the appearance of their gods first those of balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam who were filled with joy at last we have found that for which we searched they said and the first that appeared was tohil as this god was called and balamquitzé put him on his back in his chest instantly the god called avilix appeared and balamacab carried him the god called hacavitz was carried by mahucutah and iquibalam carried the one called nicahtacah and together with the people of the quiché they also received those of tamub and in the same way tohil was the name of the god of the tamub who received the grandfather and father of the lords of tamub whom we know today in the third place were those of ilocab tohil was also the name of the god who was received by the grandfathers and the fathers of the lords whom we also know today in this way the three quiché families were given their names and they did not separate because they had a god of the same name tohil of the quiché tohil of the tamub and tohil of the ilocab one only was the name of the god and therefore the three quiché families did not separate great indeed was the virtue of the three tohil avilix and hacavitz then all the people arrived those from rabinal the cakchiquel those from tziquinahá and the people who now are called the yaqui and there it was that the speech of the tribes changed their tongues became different they could no longer understand each other clearly after arriving at tulán there also they separated there were some who had to go to the east but many came here and their clothing was only the skins of animals they had no good clothes to put on the skins of animals were their only dress they were poor they possessed nothing but they had the nature of extraordinary men when they arrived at tulánzuivá vucubpec vucubzivan the old traditions say that they had traveled far in order to arrive there and they did not have fire only the people of tohil had it he was the god of the tribes which first created fire it is not known how it was made because it was already burning when balamquitzé and balamacab saw it ah we have no fire yet we shall die of cold they said then tohil said to them do not worry yours shall be the lost fire which is talked of yours shall be what is spoken of as lost fire tohil said to them really oh god our support our maintenance thou our god they said returning thanks and tohil answered very well certainly i am your god so shall it be i am your lord so let it be thus it was told to the priests and sacrificers by tohil and in this manner the tribes received fire and they were joyful because of it instantly a great shower began to fall when the fire of the tribes was burning much hail fell on all the tribes and the fire was put out because of it and again the fire was extinguished then balamquitzé and balamacab again asked tohil for fire oh tohil we are truly dying of cold they said to tohil very well do not worry tohil answered and instantly he made fire turning about in his shoe balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam were at once happy and immediately they became warm now the fire of the peoples of vucamag had also gone out and they were dying of cold immediately they came to ask balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam for fire they could no longer bear the cold nor the ice they were shivering and their teeth were chattering they were numb their legs and hands shook and they could not hold anything in them when they came we are not ashamed to come before you to beg for a little of your fire they said but they were not well received and then the tribes were very sad the speech of balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam is different oh we have given up our speech what have we done we are lost how were we deceived we had only one speech when we arrived there at tulán we were created and educated in the same way it is not good what we have done said all the tribes under the trees under the vines then a man came before balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam and this man who was a messenger of xibalba spoke thus this is in truth your god this is your support this is furthermore the representation the memory of your creator and maker do not give your fire to the tribes until they present offerings to tohil it is not necessary that they give anything to you ask tohil what they should give when they come to receive fire said the man from xibalba he had wings like the wings of a bat i am sent by your creator your maker said the man of xibalba they were filled with joy then and tohil avilix and hacavitz were also gladdened when the man from xibalba spoke who disappeared instantly from their presence but the tribes did not perish when they came although they were dying of cold there was much hail black rain and mist and indescribable cold all the tribes were trembling and shivering with cold when they came where balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam were their hearts were greatly troubled and their mouths and eyes were sad in a moment the beggars came before balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam and said will you not have pity on us we only ask a little of your fire perchance were we not once together and reunited did we not have the same home and one country when we were created when we were made have mercy then on us they said what will you give us so that we shall have mercy on you they were asked well then we shall give you money the tribes answered we do not want money said balamquitzé and balamacab and what do you want asked the tribes we shall ask now said balamquitzé very well said the tribes we shall ask tohil and then we shall tell you they answered what must the tribes give oh tohil who have come to ask for your fire said balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam well are they willing to give their waist and their armpits do they want me to embrace them for if they do not want to do that neither shall i give them fire answered tohil tell them that this shall come later that they do not have to come now to give me their waist and their armpits this is what tohil orders us to tell you you will say this was the answer to balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam then they took tohils message very well we shall join you and we shall embrace him they the people said when they heard and were told the message from tohil and they did not delay in acting good they said but may it be soon and immediately they received the fire then they became warm there was nevertheless a tribe who stole the fire in the smoke and they were from the house of zotzil the god of the cakchiquel was called chamalcán and he had the form of a bat when they passed through the smoke they went softly and then they seized the fire the cakchiquel did not ask for the fire because they did not want to give themselves up to be overcome the way that the other tribes had been overcome when they offered their breasts and their armpits so that they would be opened and this was the opening of the breasts about which tohil had spoken that they should sacrifice all the tribes before him that they should tear out their hearts from their breasts and this had not yet begun when the taking of power and sovereignty by balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam was prophesied by tohil there in tulánzuivá whence they had come they were accustomed to fast they observed a perpetual fast while they awaited the coming of dawn and watched for the rising sun they took turns at watching the great star called icoquih which rises first before the sun when the sun rises the brilliant icoquih which was always before them in the east when they were there in the place called tulánzuivá whence came their god it was not here then where they received their power and sovereignty but there they subdued and subjected the large and small tribes when they sacrificed them before tohil and offered him the blood the substance breasts and sides of all the men in tulán power came instantly to them great was their wisdom in the darkness and in the night then they came they pulled up stakes there and left the east this is not our home let us go and see where we should settle tohil said then in truth he was accustomed to talk to balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam give thanks before setting out do what is necessary to bleed your ears prick your elbows and make your sacrifices this shall be your thanks to god very well they said and took blood from their ears and they wept in their chants because of their departure from tulán their hearts mourned when they left tulán pity us we shall not see the dawn here when the sun rises and lights the face of the earth they said at leaving but they left some people on the road which they followed so that they would keep watch each of the tribes kept getting up to see the star which was the herald of the sun this sign of the dawn they carried in their hearts when they came from the east and with the same hope they left there from that great distance according to what their songs now say they came at last to the top of a mountain and there all the quiché people and the tribes were reunited there they all held council to make their plans today this mountain is called chipixab this is the name of the mountain there they reunited and there they extolled themselves i am i the people of the quiché and thou tamub that shall be thy name and to those from ilocab they said thou ilocab this shall be thy name and these three quiché peoples shall not disappear our fate is the same they said when they gave them their names then they gave the cakchiquel their name gagchequeleb was their name in the same way they named those of rabinal which was their name and they still have it and also those of tziquinahá as they are called today those are the names which they gave to each other there they were come together to await the dawn and to watch for the coming of the star which comes just before the sun when it is about to rise we came from there but we have separated they said to each other and their hearts were troubled they were suffering greatly they did not have food they did not have sustenance they only smelled the ends of their staffs and thus they imagined they were eating but they did not eat when they came it is not quite clear however how they crossed the sea they crossed to this side as if there were no sea they crossed on stones placed in a row over the sand for this reason they were called stones in a row sand under the sea names given to them when they the tribes crossed the sea the waters having parted when they passed and their hearts were troubled when they talked together because they had nothing to eat only a drink of water and a handful of corn they had there they were then assembled on the mountain called chipixab and they had also brought tohil avilix and hacavitz balamquitzé and his wife cahápaluna which was the name of his wife observed a complete fast and so did balamacab and his wife who was called chomihá and mahucutah and his wife called tzununihá also observed a complete fast and iquibalam with his wife called caquixahá likewise and there were those who fasted in the darkness and in the night great was their sorrow when they were on the mountain called chipixab and their gods spoke to them again thus tohil avilix and hacavitz spoke to balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam let us go let us get up let us not stay here take us to a secret place already dawn draws near would it not be a disgrace for you if we were imprisoned by our enemies within these walls where you the priests and sacrificers keep us put each of us then in a safe place they said when they spoke very well we shall go on we shall go in search of the forests all answered immediately after they took up their gods and put them on their backs in this way they carried avilix to the ravine called euabalziván so named by them to the large ravine of the forest now called pavilix and there they left him in this ravine he was left by balamacab they were left one by one the first one left was hacavitz he was left on a large red pyramid on the mountain now called hacavitz there they founded their town there in the place where the god called hacavitz was in the same way mahucutah left his god who was the second one hidden by them hacavitz was not in the forest but on a hill cleared of trees hacavitz was hidden then balamquitzé came he came there to the large forest balamquitzé came to hide tohil at the hill which is today called patohil then they celebrated the hiding of tohil in the ravine in his refuge a great quantity of snakes jaguars vipers and cantiles were in the forest where they were hidden by the priests and sacrificers balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam were together together they awaited the dawn there on the mountain called hacavitz and a short distance away was the god of the people of tamub and of the people of ilocab amactan the place is called where the god of the tamub people was and there dawn came to the tribes the place where those from ilocab awaited the dawn was called amacuquincat there was the god of those of ilocab a short distance from the mountain there too were all the people of rabinal the cakchiquel the tziquinahá all the small tribes and the large tribes together they stayed awaiting the coming of the dawn and the rising of the large star called icoquih which rises just before the sun when it dawns according to the legend there they were together then balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam they did not sleep they remained standing and great was the anxiety of their hearts and their stomachs for the coming of dawn and the day there too they felt shame they were overcome with great sorrow great suffering and they were oppressed with pain they had come that far oh we have come without joy if only we could see the rising of the sun what shall we do now if we lived in harmony in our country why did we leave it they said to each other in the midst of their sadness and affliction and with mournful voices they talked but they could not calm their hearts which were anxious for the coming of the dawn the gods are seated in the ravines in the forests they are among the airplants among the mosses not even a seat of boards were they given they said first there were tohil avilix and hacavitz great was their glory their strength and their power over the gods of all the tribes many were their miracles and countless their journeys and their pilgrimages in the midst of the cold and the hearts of the tribes were filled with fear but calm were the hearts of balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam with respect to them the gods they felt no anxiety in their hearts for the gods whom they had received and had carried on their backs when they came there from tulánzuivá from there in the east they were there then in the forest now called zaquiribal patohil pavilix pahacavitz and next came the dawn and light shone for our grandparents and our parents now we shall tell of the coming of the dawn and the appearance of the sun the moon and the stars here then is the dawn and the coming of the sun the moon and the stars balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam were very happy when they saw the morning star it rose first with shining face when it came ahead of the sun immediately they unwrapped the incense which they had brought from the east and which they had planned to burn and then they untied the three gifts which they had planned to offer the incense which balamquitzé brought was called mixtánpom the incense which balamacab brought was called cavixtánpom and that which mahucutah brought was called cabauilpom the three had their incense and burned it when they began to dance facing toward the east they wept for joy as they danced and burned their incense their precious incense then they wept because they did not yet behold nor see the sunrise but then the sun came up the small and large animals were happy and arose from the banks of the river in the ravines and on the tops of the mountains and all turned their eyes to where the sun was rising then the puma and the jaguar roared but first the bird called queletzú burst into song in truth all the animals were happy and the eagle the white vulture the small birds and the large birds stretched their wings the priests and the sacrificers were kneeling great was the joy of the priests and sacrificers and of the people of tamub and ilocab and the people of rabinal the cakchiquel those from tziquinahá and those from tuhalhá uchabahá quibahá from batená and the yaqui tepeu all those tribes which exist today and it was not possible to count the people the light of dawn fell upon all the tribes at the same time instantly the surface of the earth was dried by the sun like a man was the sun when it showed itself and its face glowed when it dried the surface of the earth before the sun rose damp and muddy was the surface of the earth before the sun came up but then the sun rose and came up like a man and its heat was unbearable it showed itself when it was born and remained fixed in the sky like a mirror certainly it was not the same sun which we see it is said in their old tales immediately afterward tohil avilix and hacavitz were turned to stone together with the deified beings the puma the jaguar the snake the cantil and the hobgoblin their arms became fastened to the trees when the sun the moon and the stars appeared all alike were changed into stone perhaps we should not be living today because of the voracious animals the puma the jaguar the snake and the cantil as well as the hobgoblin perhaps our power would not exist if these first animals had not been turned into stone by the sun when the sun arose the hearts of balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam were filled with joy great was their joy when it dawned and there were not many men at that place only a few were there on the mountain hacavitz there dawn came to them there they burned their incense and danced turning their gaze toward the east whence they had come there were their mountains and their valleys whence had come balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam as they were called but it was here where they multiplied on the mountain and this was their town here they were too when the sun the moon and the stars appeared when it dawned and the face of the earth and the whole world was lighted here too began their song which they call camucú they sang it but only the pain in their hearts and their innermost selves they expressed in their song oh pity us in tulán we were lost we were separated and there our older and younger brothers stayed ah we have seen the sun but where are they now that it has dawned so said the priests and the sacrificers of the yaqui because in truth the socalled tohil is the same god of the yaqui the one called yolcuatquitzalcuat we became separated there in tulán in zuyva from there we went out together and there our race was created when we came they said to each other then they remembered their older brothers and their younger brothers the yaqui to whom dawn came there in the land which today is called mexico part of the people remained there in the east those called tepeu olimán who stayed there they say they felt much grief in their hearts there in hacavitz and sad too were the people from tamub and ilocab who were also there in the forest called amactan where dawn came to the priests and sacrificers of tamub and to their god who also was tohil because one and the same was the name of the god of the three branches of the quiché people and this is also the name of the god of the people of rabinal for there is little difference between that and the name of huntoh as the god of the people of rabinal is called for that reason it is said they wanted to make their speech the same as that of the quiché well the speech of the cakchiquel is different because the name of their god was different when they came from there from tulánzuyva tzotzihá chimalcan was the name of their god and today they speak a different tongue and also from their god the families of ahpozotzil and ahpoxa as they are called took their names the speech of the god was also changed when they were given their god there in tulán near the stone their speech was changed when they came from tulán in the darkness and being together dawn came to them and the light shone on all the tribes in the order of the names of the gods of each of the tribes and now we shall tell of their stay and abode there on the mountain where the four called balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam were together their hearts mourned for tohil avilix and hacavitz whom they had placed among the airplants and the moss we shall tell now how they made the sacrifices at the foot of the place where they had carried tohil when they arrived in the presence of tohil and avilix they went to see them to greet them and also to give them thanks for the arrival of the dawn they were in the thicket amidst the stones there in the woods and only by magic art did they speak when the priests and sacrificers came before tohil they did not bring great gifts only resin the remains of the gum called noh and pericón they burned before their gods then tohil spoke only by a miracle he gave counsel to the priests and sacrificers and they the gods spoke and said truly here shall be our mountains and our valleys we are yours great shall be our lory and numerous our descendents through the work of all men yours are all the tribes and we your companions care for your town and we shall give you your learning do not show us before the tribes when we are angered by the words of their mouths or because of their conduct neither shall you permit us to fall into a snare give us instead the creatures of the woods and of the fields and also the female deer and the female birds come and give us a little of your blood have pity upon us you may have the skins of the deer and guard us from those whose eyes have deceived us so then the skin of the deer shall be our symbol which you shall show before the tribes when they ask where is tohil show the deerskin before their eyes neither shall you show yourselves for you shall have other things to do great shall be their position you shall dominate all the tribes you shall bring your blood and their substance before us and those who come to embrace us shall be ours also thus spoke tohil avilix and hacavitz they had the appearance of youths when those who came to offer gifts saw them then the persecution of the young of the birds and of the deer began and the fruit of the chase was received by the priests and sacrificers and when they found the young of the birds and the deer they went at once to place the blood of the deer and of the birds in the mouths of the stones that were tohil and avilix as soon as the blood had been drunk by the gods the stones spoke when the priests and the sacrificers came when they came to bring their offerings and they did the same before their symbols burning pericón and holomocox the symbols of each one were there where they had been placed on the top of the mountain but they the priests did not live in their houses by day but walked over the mountains and ate only the young horseflies and the wasps and the bees which they hunted they had neither good food nor good drink and neither were the roads from their homes known nor did they know where their wives had remained now then many towns were being founded one by one and the different branches of the tribes were being reunited and settled close to the roads their roads which they had opened as for balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam it was not known where they were but when they saw the tribes that passed on the roads instantly they began to shout on the mountaintops howling like a coyote screaming like a mountain cat and imitating the roaring of the puma and the jaguar and the tribes seeing these things as they walked said their screams are like those of the coyote of the mountain cat of the puma and of the jaguar they want to appear to the tribes as though they are not men and they only do this to deceive us we the people their hearts wish something surely they do not frighten us with what they do they mean something with the roaring of the puma with the noise of the jaguar which they break into when they see one or two men walking what they want is to make an end of us every day they the priests came to their houses and to their women carrying only the young of the bumblebees and the wasps and the honeybees to give to their women every day too they came before tohil avilix and hacavitz and said in their hearts here are tohil avilix and hacavitz we can offer them only the blood of the deer and the birds we take only blood from our ears and our arms let us ask tohil avilix and hacavitz for strength and vigor what will the tribes say about the deaths of the people which one by one we are killing they said to one another as they went into the presence of tohil avilix and hacavitz then they punctured their ears and their arms before the divinities they caught their blood and put it in a vase near the stones they were not really stones but each one appeared in the likeness of a youth they were happy with the blood of the priests and sacrificers when they arrived with this example of their work follow their tracks those of the animals which they sacrificed there is your salvation from there from tulán whence you brought us they were told came the skin called pazilizib which was given to you smeared with blood spill your blood and let this be the offering of tohil avilix and hacavitz here is how balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam began the abduction of the men of the tribes of vuc amag then came the killing of the tribes they seized a man as he walked alone or two when they were walking together and it was not known when they were seized and then they went to sacrifice them before tohil and avilix afterward they sprinkled the blood on the road and placed the heads separately on the road and the tribes said the jaguar ate them and they spoke thus because like footprints of the jaguar were the tracks which they had left although they did not show themselves already many were the men who had been carried off but the tribes did not notice it until later could it be tohil and avilix who have been here among us it must be they who are nourished by the priests and the sacrificers where are their homes let us follow their footprints said all the people then they held a council among themselves then they began to follow the footprints of the priests and the sacrificers but they were not clear there were only tracks of wild animals tracks of jaguars that they saw but the tracks were not distinct the first ones were not clear because they were reversed as though made so that the people went astray and their way was not clear a mist formed a black rain fell and made much mud and it began to drizzle this was what the people saw before them and their hearts became weary of searching and following them on the roads because the beings of tohil avilix and hacavitz were so great that the latter withdrew to the summit of the mountains in the vicinity of the people whom they killed thus began the abduction of the people when the sorcerers caught the tribes in the roads and sacrificed them before tohil avilix and hacavitz but their own sons they saved there on the mountain tohil avilix and hacavitz had the appearance of three youths and walked by virtue of the magic stone there was a river in which they bathed at the edge of the water and only there did they appear for this reason it was called in the bathing place of tohil and this was the name of the river often the tribes saw them but they disappeared immediately when they were seen by the people then they had tidings of where balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam were and at once the tribes held council as to the way in which they could be killed in the first place the tribes wanted to discuss the way to overcome tohil avilix and hacavitz and all the priests and sacrificers of the tribes said to the people arise all of you call everyone let there be not one group nor two groups among us who remain behind the others all assembled they assembled in great numbers and deliberated among themselves and they said asking each other what shall we do to overcome the quiché of cavec by whose hands our sons and vassals are being killed it is not known how our people are being destroyed if we must perish because of these abductions so let it be and if the power of tohil avilix and hacavitz is so great then let our god be this tohil and god grant that you take him captive it is not possible that they shall overcome us are there not perchance enough men among us and the cavec are not many they said when all were assembled and some said turning to the tribes when they spoke who has seen those who bathe in the river every day if they are tohil avilix and hacavitz then we shall overcome them first and afterward we shall begin the destruction of the priests and sacrificers this many of them said when they talked but how shall we overcome them they asked again this shall be our way of overcoming them since they have the appearance of youths when they let themselves be seen in the water then let two maidens who are really beautiful and very lovely go and provoke in them desire to possess them they said very well let us go then let us find two beautiful maidens they exclaimed and then they went to find their daughters and truly beautiful were the maidens then they instructed the maidens go our daughters go to wash clothes at the river and if you see the three youths undress before them and if their hearts desire you call to them if they say to you may we come to you answer yes and when they ask where do you come from whose daughters are you tell them we are daughters of the lords then you shall say give us a token of yours and if after they have given you something they want to kiss your faces really give yourselves to them and if you do not give yourselves to them we shall kill you afterward our hearts shall be satisfied when you have the token bring it here and this shall be proof in our judgment that they were joined with you thus spoke the lords when they advised the two maidens here are their names xtah was the name of one of the maidens and the other was xpuch and the two maidens xtah and xpuch were sent to the river to the bathing place of tohil avilix and hacavitz this is what was decided by all the tribes they went at once well adorned and they were truly very beautiful when they went there where tohil was bathing so that they would be seen when they were washing when they went the lords were happy because they had sent their two daughters as soon as the latter arrived at the river they began to wash the two had already taken off their clothes and were bending over the stones when tohil avilix and hacavitz came they came there to the edge of the river and paused a moment surprised to see the two young girls who were washing and the girls became ashamed at the moment when tohil came but the two girls did not appeal to tohil and then he asked them where did you come from thus he asked the two maidens and added what do you want that you come here to the edge of our water and they answered the lords have sent us to come here go look at the faces of tohil and speak with them the lords told us and then bring proof that you have seen their faces they told us thus the two girls spoke making known the purpose of their coming well what the tribes wanted was that the two maidens would be violated by the incarnation of tohil but tohil avilix and hacavitz said speaking again to xtah and xpuch as the two maidens were called very well with you shall go proof of our conversation wait a little and then you shall give it to the lords they said then they held council with the priests and sacrificers and they said to balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam paint three capes paint on them the symbol of your being in order that it may be recognized by the tribes when the maidens who are washing carry them back give the capes to them balamquitzé balamacab and mahucutah were told at once the three began to paint first balamquitzé painted a jaguar the figure was made and painted on the surface of the cape then balamacab painted the figure of an eagle on the surface of a cape and then mahucutah painted bumblebees and wasps all over figures and drawings of which he painted on the cloth and the three finished their painting three pieces they painted then they went to give the capes to xtah and xpuch as they were called and balamquitzé balamacab and mahucutah said to them here is proof of your conversation with us take these before the lords say to them in truth tohil has talked to us here we bring the proof tell them and have them dress themselves in the clothes which you will give them this they told the maidens when they bade them farewell the latter went at once carrying the abovementioned painted capes when they arrived the lords were filled with joy to see their faces and their hands from which hung the things the maidens had gone for did you see the face of tohil they asked them yes we saw it answered xtah and xpuch very well and you bring the token do you not the lords asked thinking that this was the proof of their sin then the maidens held out the painted capes all covered with the figures of jaguars and eagles and covered with bumblebees and wasps painted on the surface of the cloth and which shone before them at once they felt a desire to put the capes on the jaguar did nothing when the lord threw the first painting on his back then the lord put on the second painting with the figure of the eagle the lord felt very well wrapped within it and he turned about before all of them then he undressed before all and put on the third painted cape and now he had on himself the bumblebees and wasps which were on it instantly the bumblebees and the wasps stung his flesh and not being able to suffer the stings of these insects he began to scream because of the insects whose figures were painted on the cloth the painting of mahucutah which was the third one that had been painted thus they were overcome then the lords reprimanded the two maidens named xtah and xpuch what kind of clothes are those which you have brought where did you go to bring them you devils they said to the maidens when they reprimanded them all the people were overcome by tohil well what they the lords wanted was that tohil should have gone to amuse himself with xtah and xpuch and that the maidens would have become whores for the tribes believed that they would serve to tempt them but it was not possible that they should overcome them thanks to those miraculous men balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam afterwards the tribes held council again what shall we do with them in truth their estate is very great they said when they assembled again in council well then we shall waylay them we shall kill them we shall arm ourselves with bows and with shields perchance are we not many let there not be one or two among us who remains behind this they said when they held council and all the people armed many were the warriors when all the people gathered together for the killing meanwhile there were balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam they were on the mountain hacavitz on the hill of this name they were there in order to save their sons who were on the mountain and they did not have many people they did not have multitudes such as the multitudes of the tribes the summit of the mountain where they had their place was small and for that reason when the tribes assembled together and rose they decided to kill all of them in this manner then took place the reunion of all the people all armed with their bows and their shields it is impossible to describe the richness of their arms the appearance of all the chiefs and men was very beautiful and certainly all obeyed their orders they shall positively be destroyed and as for tohil he shall be our god we shall worship him if we take him prisoner they said to each other but tohil knew everything and so did balamquitzé balamacab and mahucutah they heard all the plans because they did not sleep or rest from the time the warriors armed themselves then all the warriors rose up and started out on the road intending to enter the town by night but they did not arrive for all the warriors were watching on the road and then they were destroyed by balamquitzé balamacab and mahucutah all remained watching along the road but they heard nothing and they finally fell asleep then they balamquitzé balamacab and mahucutah began to pull out their eyelashes and their beards they took off the metal ornaments from their throatstheir crowns and necklaces and they took the metal from the handles of their spears they did this to punish them and humiliate them and give them an example of the power of the quiché people when they the warriors awoke they wanted to take their crowns and their staffs but they no longer had metal in the staffhandles nor their crowns who has stripped us who has torn out our beards whence have they come to rob us of our precious metals said all of the warriors can it be these devils who are carrying off the men but they shall not succeed in frightening us we shall enter their town by force and we shall again see the face of our silver this we shall do said all the tribes and all truly intended to carry out their word meanwhile the hearts of the priests and the sacrificers on the summit of the mountain were calm and balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam having talked together they built a wall at the edge of the town and enclosed it with boards and thorns then they made figures in the form of men and put them in rows on the wall armed them with shields and arrows and adorned them putting metal crowns on their heads these they put on the simple wooden figures they adorned them with the metal which they had taken from the tribes on the road and with them they decorated the figures they made a moat around the town and then they asked advice of tohil shall they kill us shall they overcome us their hearts said to tohil do not be troubled i am here and this you will use do not be afraid he tohil said to balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam when they were given the bumblebees and the wasps this is what they went to fetch and when they came they put them inside four big gourds which were placed around the town they shut the bumblebees and wasps inside the gourds in order to fight the people with them the city was watched from afar spied upon and observed by the scouts of the tribes they are not many they said but they saw only the wooden figures which lightly moved their bows and their shields in truth they had the appearance of men had in truth the appearance of warriors when the tribes looked at them and all the tribes were happy because they saw that they were not many there were many tribes it was not possible to count the people the warriors and soldiers who were going to kill balamquitzé balamacab and mahucutah who were on the mountain hacavitz the name of the place where they were found now we shall tell about their arrival they were there then balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam were all together on the mountain with their wives and their children when all the warriors and soldiers came the tribes did not number sixteen thousand or twentyfour thousand men but even more they surrounded the town crying out loudly armed with arrows and shields beating drums giving war whoops whistling shouting inciting them to fight when they arrived in front of the town but the priests and sacrificers were not frightened they only looked at them from the edge of the wall where they were in good order with their wives and children they thought only of the strength and the shouting of the tribes when they came up the side of the mountain shortly before they were about to throw themselves at the entrance of the town the four gourds which were at the edge of the town were opened and the bumblebees and the wasps came out of the gourds like a great cloud of smoke they emerged from the gourds and thus the warriors perished because of the insects which stung the pupils of their eyes and fastened themselves to their noses their mouths their legs and their arms where are they they said those who went to get and bring in all the bumblebees and wasps that are here they went straight to sting the pupils of their eyes the little insects buzzing in swarms over each one of the men and the latter stunned by the bumblebees and wasps could no longer grasp their bows and their shields which were broken on the ground when the warriors fell they were stretched out on the mountainside and they no longer felt when they were hit with arrows and wounded by the axes balamquitzé and balamacab used only blunt sticks their wives also took part in this killing only a part of them returned and all the tribes began to flee but the first ones caught were put to death not a few of the men died and those who died were not the ones they intended to kill but those who were attacked by the insects neither was it a deed of valor because the warriors were not killed by arrows or by shields then all the tribes surrendered the people humbled themselves before balamquitzé balamacab and mahucutah have pity on us do not kill us they exclaimed very well although you deserve to die you shall instead become our vassals for the rest of your lives they said to them in this way were all of the tribes destroyed by our first mothers and fathers and this happened there on the mountain hacavitz as it is now called this was where they first settled where they multiplied and increased begot their daughters gave being to their sons on the mountain hacavitz they were then very happy when they had overcome all the tribes whom they destroyed there on the mountaintop in this way they carried out the destruction of the tribes of all the tribes after this their hearts rested and they said to their sons that when they the tribes intended to kill them the hour of their own death was approaching and now we shall tell of the death of balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam as they were called and as they had had a presentiment of their death they counseled their children they were not ill they had neither pain nor agony when they gave their advice to their children these are the names of their sons balamquitzé had two sons qocaib the first was called and qocavib was the name of the second son of balamquitzé the grandfather and father of those of cavec and these are the two sons which balamacab begot here are their names qoacul the first of his sons was called and qoacutec was the name of the second son of balamacab the founder of those of nihaib mahucutah had but one son who was called qoahau those three had sons but iquibalam did not have children they were really the sacrificers and these are the names of their sons so then they bade their sons farewell the four were together and they began to sing feeling sad in their hearts and their hearts wept when they sang the camucú as the song is called which they sang when they bade farewell to their sons oh our sons we are going we are going away sane advice and wise counsel we leave you and you also who came from our distant country oh our wives they said to their women and they bade farewell to each one we are going back to our town there already in his place is our lord of the stags to be seen there in the sky we are going to begin our return we have completed our mission here our days are ended think then of us do not erase us from your memory nor forget us you shall see your homes and your mountains again settle there and so let it be go on your way and you shall see again the place from which we came these words they said when they bade them farewell then balamquitzé left the symbol of his being this is a remembrance which i leave you this shall be your power i take my leave filled with sorrow he added then he left the symbol of his being the pizomgagal as it was called whose form was invisible because it was wrapped up and could not be unwrapped the seam did not show because it was not seen when they wrapped it up in this way they took their leave and immediately they disappeared there on the summit of the mountain hacavitz they the four lords were not buried by their wives nor by their children because they were not seen when they disappeared only their leaving was seen dearly and therefore the bundle was very dear to them it was the reminder of their fathers and at once they burned incense before this reminder of their fathers and then the lords who succeeded balamquitzé begot new generations of men and this was the beginning of the grandfathers and fathers of those of cavec but their sons those called qocaib and qocavib did not disappear in this way the four died our first grandfathers and fathers in this way they disappeared leaving their children on the mountain hacavitz there where they have remained and the people being subdued already and their grandeur ended the tribes no longer had power and all lived to serve daily they remembered their fathers great was the glory of the bundle to them never did they unwrap it but it was always wrapped and with them bundle of greatness they called it when they extolled and named that which their fathers had left in their care as a symbol of their being in this manner then came about the disappearance and end of balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam the first men who came there from the other side of the sea where the sun rises they had been here a long time when they died being very old the chiefs and sacrificers as they were called then they decided to go to the east thinking thus to fulfill the command of their fathers which they had not forgotten it had been a long time since their fathers had died when the tribes gave them their wives and thus they acquired many relativesinlaw when the three took wives and starting on their journey they said we are going to the east there whence came our fathers so they said when the three sons set out one was called qocaib and he was the son of balamquitzé of the cavec the one called qoacutec was son of balamacab of the nihaib and the other called qoahau was son of mahucutah of the ahauquiché these then are the names of those who went there to the other side of the sea the three went then and were endowed with intelligence and experience but they were not common men they took leave of all their brothers and relatives and left joyfully we shall not die we shall return said the three when they left certainly they crossed the sea when they came there to the east when they went to receive the investiture of the kingdom and this was the name of the lord king of the east where they went when they arrived before lord nacxit which was the name of the great lord the only supreme judge of all the kingdoms he gave them the insignia of the kingdom and all its distinctive symbols then came the insignia of ahpop and ahpopcamhá and then the insignia of the grandeur and the sovereignty of the ahpop and the ahpopcamhá and nacxit ended by giving them the insignia of royalty which are the canopy the throne the flutes of bone the chamcham yellow beads puma claws jaguar claws the heads and feet of the deer dais snail shells tobacco little gourds parrot feathers standards of royal aigrette feathers tatam and caxcon all the foregoing they carried those who came after going to the other side of the sea to receive the paintings of tulán the paintings as these were called in which they wrote their histories then having arrived at their town called hacavitz all the people of tamub and of ilocab assembled there all the tribes were assembled and were filled with joy when qocaib qoacutec and qoahau arrived and there they again assumed the rule of the tribes the people of rabinal the cakchiquel and the people of tziquinahá rejoiced before them they showed the insignia of the grandeur of the kingdom great too were the tribes although they had not finished showing their might and they were there in hacavitz all were there with those who came from the east there they spent much time there on the summit of the mountain they were in great numbers there too the wives of balamquitzé balamacab and mahucutah died later they left abandoning their country and searching for other places in which to settle innumerable were the places in which they settled where they were and which they named there our first mothers and our first fathers were reunited and increased so said the old people when they told how they left their first capital called hacavitz and went to found another capital called chiquix they were a long time in this other town where they had daughters and sons there were many of them there and there were four other places to each of which they gave the name of their town their daughters and sons married they simply gave them away in marriage and the presents and favors they received they considered as the price for their daughters and in this way they lived happily afterward they went through each one of the wards of the town the different names of which are chiquix chichac humetahá culbá and cavinal these were the names of the places where they settled and they surveyed the hills and their towns and sought the uninhabited places for all together they were now very many those who had gone to the east to receive the sovereignty were now dead they were already old when they arrived at each of the towns they did not become accustomed to the different places through which they passed they suffered many hardships and troubles and only after a long time did the grandfathers and fathers arrive at their town here is the name of the city to which they came finally qocaib returned and gave an account of his mission he brought the titles of ahpop ahtzalam tzanchinamital and many others he showed the insignia which must accompany these titles and they were the claws of the jaguars and eagles skins of other animals and also stones sticks etc seeing his wife with a newly born child in her arms he asked whence it had come it is of thy blood answered the woman of thy flesh and thy same bones qocaib accepted the explanation and taking the childs cradle said from today on and forever this child shall be called balam conaché and the latter began the house of conaché and iztayul with respect to the second journey of the quiché princes the título says that they returned satisfied to hacavitz chipal and displayed the signs and symbols which they brought chiizmachí is the name of the site of their town where they were afterward and where they settled there under the fourth generation of kings they developed their power and constructed buildings of mortar and stone and conaché and belehebqueh the galelahau ruled then king cotuhá and iztayul reigned as they were called the ahpop and the ahpopcamhá who reigned there in izmachí which was the beautiful city which they had built only three great houses were there in izmachí there were not twentyfour great houses then only their three great houses only a great house of the cavec only a great house of the nihaib and only one of the people of ahauquiché only two had great houses the two branches of the family the quiché and the tamub and there they were in izmachí with only one thought without disputes or difficulties peaceful was the kingdom they had no quarrels nor disputes in their hearts were only peace and happiness they were not envious nor jealous their grandeur was limited they had not thought of aggrandizing themselves nor of expanding when they tried to do it they fastened the shield there in izmachí but only to give a sign of their empire as a symbol of their power and a symbol of their greatness seeing this the people of ilocab began the war they wanted to kill king cotuhá wishing to have a chief of their own and as for lord iztayul they wanted to punish him that he be punished and killed by those of ilocab but their evil plans against king cotuhá did not succeed for he fell upon them before the people of ilocab were able to kill him this then was the beginning of the revolution and the dissensions of the war first they attacked the town and the warriors came and what they wanted was to ruin the quiché race they wanted to reign alone but they only came to die they were captured and fell into captivity and few among them succeeded in escaping immediately afterward the sacrifices began the people of ilocab were sacrificed before the god and this was the punishment for their sins by order of king cotuhá many also fell into slavery and servitude they only went to give themselves up to be overcome because of having arranged the war against the lords and against the town the destruction and ruin of the quiché race and their king was what they wished but they did not succeed in accomplishing it in this way the sacrifice of men began before the gods when the war of the shields broke out which was the reason that they began the fortifications of the city of izmachí there began and originated their power because the empire of the king of the quiché was really large they were in every sense marvelous kings there was no one who could dominate them neither was there anyone who could humble them and at the same time they were the builders of the grandeur of the kingdom which they had founded there in izmachí there the fear of god waxed they were inspired with awe and the tribes large and small were filled with fear for they saw the arrival of the captives those who were sacrificed and killed because of the power and sovereignty of king cotuhá the king iztayul and the people of nihaib and ahauquiché there were only three branches of the quiché family there in izmachí as the town was called and there they also began the feasts and orgies for their daughters when suitors came to ask for them in marriage there the socalled three great houses gathered and there they drank their drinks there they also ate their food which was the price of their sisters the price of their daughters and their hearts were joyful when they did it and they ate and drank in the great houses in this way we show our gratitude and thus we open the road for our posterity and our descendants this is the demonstration of our consent to their becoming husbands and wives they said there they identified themselves and there they took their names they distributed themselves in clans in the seven principal tribes and in cantons let us unite we of the cavec we of the nihaib and we of the ahauquiché said the three clans and the three great houses for a long time they were there in izmachí until they found and saw another town and abandoned that of izmachí after they had left there they came here to the town of gumarcaah as the quiché named it when kings cotuhá and gucumatz and all the lords came there had then begun the fifth generation of men since the beginning of civilization and of the population the beginning of the existence of the nation there then they built many houses and at the same time constructed the temple of god in the center of the high part of the town they located it when they arrived and settled there then their empire grew they were very numerous when they held their council in their great houses they reunited but later divided because dissensions had arisen and jealousies grew up amongst them over the price for their sisters and their daughters and because they no longer drank together this then was the reason why they divided and why they turned against each other and they threw the skulls of the dead they hurled them around among each other then they divided into nine families and having ended the dispute over the sisters and the daughters they carried out the plan of dividing the kingdom into twentyfour great houses as they did it is a long time since they came here to their town and finished the twentyfour great houses there in the city of gumarcaah which was blessed by the bishop later the city was abandoned there they increased there they installed their splendid thrones and royal seats and they distributed their honors among all the lords the nine lords of cavec formed nine families the lords of nihaib formed another nine the lords of ahauquiché formed another four and the lords of zaquic formed another two families they became very numerous and many also followed each of the lords these were the first among their vassals and each of the lords had large families we shall tell now the names of the lords of each of the great houses here then are the names of the lords of cavec the first of the lords was ahpop then ahpopcamhá ahtohil ahgucumatz nimchocohcavec popolvinacchituy lolmetquehnay popolvinac pahom tzalatz and uchuchcamhá these then were the lords of cavec nine lords each one of which had his great house which afterward will appear again here then are the lords of nihaib the first was ahaugalel then ahauahtzicvinac galelcamhá nimacamhá uchuchcamhá nimchocohnihaibab avilix yacolatam utzampopzalclatol and nimálolmetycoltux the nine lords of nihaib and as for those of ahauquiché these are the names of the lords ahtzicvinac ahaulolmet ahaunimchocohahau and ahauhacavitz four lords of ahauquiché in the order of their great houses and the house of zaquic had two families the lords tzutuhá and galel zaquic these two lords had only one great house in this way the number of the twentyfour lords was completed and the twentyfour great houses came into being thus the grandeur and power of the sons of the quiché grew when they built the town of the ravines out of stone and mortar then the small tribes and the great tribes came before the king the quiché increased when their glory and majesty waxed when they raised the house of their gods and the house of their lords but it was not they who worked or constructed their houses either or made the house of the gods for they were made by their sons and vassals who had multiplied and they were not cheating them nor robbing them nor seizing them by force because in reality each belonged to the lords and many of their brothers and relatives had come together and had assembled to hear the commands of each of the lords the lords were really loved and great was their glory and the sons and the vassals held the birthdays of the lords in great respect when the inhabitants of the country and the city multiplied but it did not happen that all the tribes delivered themselves up and neither did the country and towns the inhabitants of them fall in battle but instead they increased because of the marvels of the lords king gucumatz and king cotuhá gucumatz was truly a marvelous king for seven days he mounted to the skies and for seven days he went down into xibalba seven days he changed himself into a snake and really became a serpent for seven days he changed himself into an eagle for seven days he became a jaguar and his appearance was really that of an eagle and a jaguar another seven days he changed himself into clotted blood and was only motionless blood the nature of this king was really marvelous and all the other lords were filled with terror before him tidings of the wonderful nature of the king were spread and all the lords of the towns heard it and this was the beginning of the grandeur of the quiché when king gucumatz gave these signs of his power his sons and his grandsons never forgot him and he did not do this in order to be an extraordinary king he did it as a means of dominating all the towns as a means of showing that only one was called upon to be chief of the people the generation of the wonderful king called gucumatz was the fourth generation and gucumatz was also the ahpop and the ahpopcamhá they left successors and descendants who reigned and ruled and begot children and did many things tepepul and iztayul whose reign was the fifth generation of kings were begotten and in the same way each of the generations of these lords had succession here are the names of the sixth generation of kings there were two great kings the first was called gagquicab and the other cavizimah and they performed heroic deeds and aggrandized the quiché for surely they were of marvelous nature here is the destruction and division of the fields and the towns of the neighboring nations small and large among them was that which in olden times was the country of the cakchiquel the present chuvilá and the country of the people of rabinal pamacá the country of the people of caoqué zaccabahá and the towns of the peoples of zaculeu of chuvimiquiná xelahuh chuvatzac and tzolohche these peoples hated quicab he made war on them and certainly conquered and destroyed the fields and towns of the people of rabinal the cakchiquel and the people of zaculeu he came and conquered all the towns and the soldiers of quicab carried his arms to distant parts one or two tribes did not bring tribute and then he fell upon all the towns and they were forced to bring tribute to quicab and cavizimah they were made slaves they were wounded and they were killed with arrows against the trees to which they had been tied and for them there was no longer any glory they no longer had power in this way came about the destruction of the towns which were instantly razed to the ground like a flash of lightning which strikes and shatters the rock so in an instant were the conquered people filled with terror before colché as a symbol of a town destroyed by him there is now a pile of stones which look almost as if they had been cut with the edge of an ax it is there on the coast called petatayub and it may be clearly seen today by people who pass as proof of the valor of quicab they could neither kill him nor overcome him for in truth he was a brave man and all the people rendered tribute unto him and all the lords having gathered in council went to fortify the ravines and the towns having conquered the towns of all the tribes then spies went out to observe the enemy and they founded something like towns in the occupied places just in case by chance the tribes might return to occupy the town they said when they reassembled in council then they went out to take up their positions these shall be like our forts and our town our walls and defenses here shall our valor and our manhood be proved said all the lords when they went to take up the position assigned to each clan in order to fight the enemy and having received their orders they went to the places that had been founded in the land of the tribes go there for now it is our land do not be afraid if there are still enemies who come to kill you come quickly and let me know and i will go to kill them said quicab when he took leave of all of them in the presence of the galel and the ahtzicvinac then the bowmen and the slingers as they were called set out then the grandfathers and the fathers of all the quiché nation took their battle positions they were on each one of the mountains and they were like guardsof the mountains they were guarding with their bows and slings they were the sentinels of the war they were not of different origin nor did they have a different god when they went they went only to fortify their towns then all the people of uvilá went out those of chulimal zaquiyá xahbaquieh chitemah vahxalahuh and the people of cabracán chabicacchihunahpú and those of macá those of xoyabah and those of zaccabahá those of ziyahá those of miquiná those of xelahuh and those of the coast they went to observe the war and to guard the land when they went by order of quicab and cavizimah who were the ahpop and the ahpopcamhá and the galel and the ahtzicvinac who were the four lords they were sent in order to watch the enemies of quicab and cavizimah names of the kings both of the house of cavec of queemá name of the lord of the people of nihaib and of achaciboy the name of the lord of the people of ahauquiché these were the names of the lords who sent them when their sons and vassals went to the mountains to each one of the mountains they went at once and they took captives they brought their prisoners into the presence of quicab cavizimah the galel and the ahtzicvinac the bowmen and slingers made war taking captives and prisoners some of the defenders of he positions were heroes and the lords gave them gifts and lavished rewards upon them when they came to deliver up all their captives and prisoners later they gathered in council by order of the lords the ahpop the ahpopcamhá the galel and the ahtzicvinac and they decided and said that those who were there first should have the rank of representing their families i am the ahpop i am the ahpopcamhá mine shall be the rank of the ahpop meanwhile thou the ahaugalel shall have the rank of galel said all the lords when they held council those of tamub and of ilocab did likewise equal in position were the three clans of the quiché when for the first time they named their sons and vassals captains and ennobled them this was the result of the council but they were not made captains here in quiché the mountain where the sons and vassals were made captains for the first time has its name when all were sent each one to his mountain and all were reunited xebalax and xecamax are the names of the mountains where they were made captains and they received their commands this happened in chulimal in this manner was the naming the promotion and distinction of the twenty galel of the twenty ahpop who were named by the ahpop and the ahpopcamhá and by the galel and the ahtzicvinac all of the galelahpops received their rank eleven nimchocoh galelahau galelzaquic galelachih rahpopachih rahtzalamachih utzamachih were the names which the warriors received when their titles and distinctions were conferred upon them as they were on their thrones and on their seats being the first sons and vassals of the quiché nation their spies their scouts the bowmen the slingers the walls doors forts and bastions of the quiché those of tamub and ilocab also did thus they named and ennobled the first sons and vassals who were in each place this then was the origin of the galelahpops and of the titles which are now preserved in each one of these places this is the way their titles were created by the ahpop and the ahpopcamhá by the galel and the ahtzicvinac they were created we shall now tell of the house of the god the house was also given the same name as the god the great edifice of tohil was the name of the temple of tohil of those of cavec avilix was the name of the temple of avilix of the people of nihaib and hacavitz was the name of the temple of the god of the people of ahauquiché tzutuhá which is seen in cahbahá is the name of a large edifice in which there was a stone which all the lords of quiché worshiped and which was also worshiped by all the tribes the people first offered their sacrifices before tohil and afterward went to pay their respects to the ahpop and the ahpopcamhá then they went to present their gorgeous feathers and their tribute before the king and the kings whom they maintained were the ahpop and the ahpopcamhá who had conquered their towns great lords and wonderful men were the marvelous kings gucumatz and cotuhá the marvelous kings quicab and cavizimah they knew if there would be war and everything was clear before their eyes they saw if there would be death and hunger if there would be strife they well knew that there was a place where it could be seen that there was a book which they called the popol vuh but not only in this way was the estate of the lords great great also were their fasts and this was in recognition of their having been created and in recognition of their having been given their kingdoms they fasted a long time and made sacrifices to their gods here is how they fasted nine men fasted and another nine made sacrifices and burned incense thirteen more men fasted and another thirteen more made offerings and burned incense before tohil and while before their god they nourished themselves only with fruits with zapotes matasanos and jocotes and they did not eat any tortillas now if there were seventeen men who made sacrifice or ten who fasted the truth is they did not eat they fulfilled their great precepts and thus showed their position as lords neither had they women to sleep with but they remained alone fasting they were in the house of god all day they prayed burning incense and making sacrifices thus they remained from dusk until dawn grieving in their hearts and in their breasts and begging for happiness and life for their sons and vassals as well as for their kingdom and raising their faces to the sky here are their petitions to their god when they prayed and this was the supplication of their hearts oh thou beauty of the day thou huracán thou heart of heaven and of earth thou giver of richness and giver of the daughters and the sons turn toward us your power and your riches grant life and growth unto my sons and vassals let those who must maintain and nourish thee multiply and increase those who invoke thee on the roads in the fields on the banks of the rivers in the ravines under the trees under the vines give them daughters and sons let them not meet disgrace nor misfortune let not the deceiver come behind or before them let them not fall let them not be wounded let them not fornicate nor be condemned by justice let them not fall on the descent or on the ascent of the road let them not encounter obstacles back of them or before them nor anything which strikes them grant them good roads beautiful level roads let them not have misfortune nor disgrace through thy fault through thy sorceries grant a good life to those who must give thee sustenance and place food in thy mouth in thy presence to thee heart of heaven heart of earth bundle of majesty and thou tohil thou avilix thou hacavitz arch of the sky surface of the earth the four corners the four cardinal points let there be but peace and tranquility in thy mouth in thy presence oh god thus spoke the lords while within the nine men fasted the thirteen men and the seventeen men during the day they fasted and their hearts grieved for their sons and vassals and for all their wives and their children when each of the lords made his offering this was the price of a happy life the price of power the price of the authority of the ahpop of the ahpopcamhá of the galel and of the ahtzicvinac two by two they ruled each pair succeeding the other in order to bear the burden of the people of all the quiché nation one only was the origin of their tradition and one only the origin of the manner of maintaining and sustaining and one only too was the origin of the tradition and the customs of those of tamub and ilocab and the people of rabinal and the cakchiquel those of tziquinahá of tuhalahá and uchabahá and there was but one trunk a single family when they heard there in quiché what all of them were to do but it was not only thus that they reigned they did not squander the gifts of those whom they sustained and nourished but they ate and drank them neither did they buy them they had won and seized their empire their power and their sovereignty and it was not at small cost that they conquered the fields and the towns the small towns and the large towns paid high ransoms they brought precious stones and metals they brought honey of the bees bracelets bracelets of emeralds and other stones and brought garlands made of blue feathers the tribute of all the towns they came into the presence of the marvelous kings gucumatz and cotuhá and before quicab and cavizimah the ahpop the ahpopcamhá the galel and the ahtzicvinac it was not little what they did neither were few the tribes which they conquered many branches of the tribes came to pay tribute to the quiché full of sorrow they came to give it over nevertheless the quiché power did not grow quickly gucumatz it was who began the aggrandizement of the kingdom thus was the beginning of his aggrandizement and that of the quiché nation and now we shall name the generations of the lords and give their names again we shall name all of the lords here then are the generations and the order of all the rulers which began with our first grandfathers and our first fathers balamquitzé balamacab mahucutah and iquibalam when the sun appeared and the moon and the stars were seen now then we shall give the beginning of the generations the order of kingdoms from the beginning of their lineage how the lords entered into power from their accessions to their deaths we shall give each generation of lords and ancestors as well as the lord of the town all and each of the lords here then the person of each one of the lords of the quiché shall be shown balamquitzé the root of those of cavec qocavib second generation of the line of balamquitzé balamconaché with whom the title of ahpop began third generation cotuhá i and iztayub fourth generation gucumatz and cotuhá ii first of the marvelous kings who were of the fifth generation tepepul and iztayul of the sixth order quicab and cavizimah of the seventh order of succession to the kingdom tepepul and iztayub eighth generation tecum and tepepul ninth generation vahxaquicaam and quicab tenth generation of kings

tepepul who paid tribute to the spaniards they left sons and the former were the thirteenth generation of kings don juan de rojas and don juan cortés the fourteenth generation of kings were the sons of tecum and tepepul these are then the generations and the order of the kingdom of the lords ahpop and ahpopcamhá of the quiché of cavec and now we shall name again the families these are the great houses of each of the lords who followed the ahpop and the ahpopcamhá these are the names of the nine families of those of cavec of the nine great houses and these are the titles of the lords of each one of the great houses ahauahpop one great house cuhá was the name of this great house ahauahpopcamhá whose great house was called tziquinahá nimchocohcavec one great house ahauahtohil one great house ahauahgucumatz one great house popolvinac chituy one great house lolmetquehnay one great house popolvinac pahom tzalatz xcuxebá one great house tepeuyaqui one great house these then are the nine families of cavec and very numerous were the sons and vassals of the tribes which followed these nine great houses here are the nine great houses of those of nihaib but first we shall give the lineage of the rulers of the kingdom from one root only these names originated when the sun began to shine with the beginning of light balamacab first grandfather and father qoacul and qoacutec second generation cochahuh and cotzibahá third generation belehebqueh i fourth generation cotuhá i fifth generation of kings batza sixth generation iztayul seventh generation of kings cotuhá ii eighth order of the kingdom belehebqueh ii ninth order quemá so called tenth generation ahaucotuhá eleventh generation don cristóval so called who ruled in the time of the spaniards don pedro de robles the present ahaugalel these then are all the kings who descended from the ahaugalel now we shall name the lords of each of the great houses ahaugalel first lord of the nihaib head of one great house ahauahtzicvinac one great house ahaugalelcamhá one great house nimacamhá one great house uchuchcamhá one great house nimchocohnihaib one great house ahauavilix one great house yacolatam one great house nimalolmetycoltux one great house these then are the great houses of the nihaib these were the names of the nine families of those of nihaib as they were called numerous were the families of each one of the lords whose names we have given first here now is the lineage of those of ahauquiché who were their grandfather and father mahucutah the first man qoahau name of the second generation of kings caglacán cocozom comahcún vucubah cocamel coyabacoh vinacbam these were the kings of those of the ahauquiché this is the order of their generations here now are the tides of the lords who made up the great houses there were only four great houses ahtzicvinacahau title of the first lord one great house lolmetahau second lord a great house nimchocohahau third lord a great house hacavitz fourth lord a great house therefore four were the great houses of the ahauquiché there were then three nimchocoh who were like fathers vested with authority of all the lords of the quiché the three chocoh came together in order to make known the orders of the mothers the orders of the fathers great was the position of the three chocoh there were then the nimchocoh of those of cavec the nimchocoh of those of nihaib who was second and the nimchocohahau of the ahauquiché who was third each one of the three chocoh represented his family and this was the life of the quiché because no longer can be seen the book of the popol vuh which the kings had in olden times for it has disappeared in this manner then all the people of the quiché which is called santa cruz came to an end
