in the beginning akongo lived with us in the sky, but he got so tired of human quarrels that he left and has not been seen since. some people tell another tale: the woman mbokomu in the sky world was so irritating to akongo and the people there that akongo dropped her, her children, and some food down to earth in a basket. the family planted and did well on earth, but mbokomu was afraid her family would die out. she convinced her son to take his sister as a wife. he did so, unwillingly, and his sister became pregnant. the sister was walking about one day when she met a very hairy but pleasant creature whom she grew to like. his name was ebenga, and when the sister shaved him he looked quite like a man. ebenga was evil, however, and he put a curse on the woman and her unborn child. the child was born and grew up to be a witch. he plagued all of the other children born to the brother and sister, as well as their descendants.
